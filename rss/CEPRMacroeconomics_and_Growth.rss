closures from Burbio, we quantify the heterogeneous impact of school closures during the
Corona crisis on children affected at different ages and coming from households with different
parental characteristics. Our data suggests that secondary schools were closed for
in-person learning for longer periods than elementary schools (implying that younger children
experienced less school closures than older children), and that private schools experienced
shorter closures than public schools, and schools in poorer U.S. counties experienced
shorter school closures. We then extend the structural life cycle model of private and
public schooling investments studied in Fuchs-SchÃ¼ndeln, Krueger, Ludwig, and Popova
(2021) to include the choice of parents whether to send their children to private schools,
empirically discipline it with data on parental investments from the PSID, and then feed
into the model the school closure measures from our empirical analysis to quantify the
long-run consequences of the Covid-19 school closures on the cohorts of children currently
in school. Future earnings- and welfare losses are largest for children that started public
secondary schools at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. Comparing children from the top to
children from the bottom quartile of the income distribution, welfare losses are ca. 0.8
percentage points larger for the poorer children if school closures were unrelated to income.
Accounting for the longer school closures in richer counties reduces this gap by about 1/3.
A policy intervention that extends schools by 3 months (6 weeks in the next two summers)
generates significant welfare gains for the children and raises future tax revenues approximately
sufficient to pay for the cost of this schooling expansion.]]></description><author>Fuchs-Schündeln, Nicola &amp; Krueger, Dirk &amp; Kurmann, Andre &amp; Lale, Etienne &amp; Ludwig, Alexander &amp; Popova, Irina</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16663</guid></item><item><title>Perpetual Motion: Human Mobility and Spatial Frictions in Three African Countries</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16661</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Blanchard, Paul & Gollin, Douglas & Kirchberger, Martina.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Recent literature points to the importance in developing countries of spatial and sectoral gaps in wages and  living standards. These gaps seemingly imply frictions to human mobility. In this paper, we present new evidence on mobility within three African countries. We use a novel data source that provides highly detailed location data on more than one million smartphone devices across three large African countries for an entire year. This allows us to examine high-frequency mobility patterns for a subset of people for whom we can determine home locations confidently. The data offer insights into patterns of mobility, with corresponding implications for the nature and extent of mobility frictions. In particular, our data point to the ubiquity of relatively high-frequency journeys within countries -- i.e., visits. We observe that many users travel to  relatively distant within-country locations, with big cities acting as particularly attractive magnets. We develop a conceptual framework that characterizes the role of visits for individuals  and provides a number of testable predictions that are consistent with the movement patterns that we observe in the data. The analysis suggests that distance-linked mobility costs are not so high as to discourage travel. In fact, travel enables users to benefit from the opportunities that large cities provide, without having to incur the costs of relocation. The frictions sustaining spatial and sectoral gaps thus seem  to reflect deep fixed costs associated with the dislocations of migration and sectoral change, rather than the direct costs of movement.]]></description><author>Blanchard, Paul &amp; Gollin, Douglas &amp; Kirchberger, Martina</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16661</guid></item><item><title>A Safe Harbor: Wealth-Income Ratios in Switzerland Over the 20th Century and the Role of Housing Prices</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16660</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Baselgia, Enea & Martínez, Isabel Z..</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We estimate the ratio of private wealth to national income, Î²pt, for Switzerland over the period 1900â??2018.

However, the wealth-income ratio has been on the rise since the turn of the century to reach 721% in 2017-a level unprecedented in the past.

We develop and carefully calibrate a model of the US economy to show that an increase in the tax rate on the value of land, balanced by decreases in the tax rates on the incomes of capital and labor, can meet this need. We find that the US share of land in total nonfinancial assets is more than 50%, so that the tax base is very large. This is corroborated by very high quality OECD data for other industrialized economies that, almost without exception, find land shares of between 40% and 60%. Our baseline proposed tax reform is an increase in the tax rate on the asset value of land from its current 0.55% to 5.55%, accompanied by reductions in tax rates on capital and labor incomes of 28 and 10 percentage points, respectively. In a representative household model, this increases welfare by 3.4% of steady state consumption, and increases output by almost 15% relative to trend. In an economy with separate groups of workers, capitalists and landlords, the output gain is the same, while the welfare gain increases to 6.4% on average across the three groups. Welfare and output gains for a wealth tax that raises the same revenue, and which increases the tax rates on capital and land equally, are only half as large as the baseline. Welfare and output gains for an optimal tax reform, under the assumption that the tax rate on the value of land is capped at 20%, are approximately twice as large as the baseline. This reform raises 55% of all tax revenue through land taxes, with the remaining 45% raised through consumption taxes, while all income taxes are abolished.]]></description><author>Goodhart, Charles A &amp; Hudson, Michael &amp; Kumhof, Michael &amp; Tideman, Nicolaus</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16652</guid></item><item><title>Direct and Spillover Effects from Staggered Adoption of Health Policies: Evidence from Covid-19 Stay-at-Home Orders</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16649</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Elenev, Vadim & Quintero, Luis & Rebucci, Alessandro & Simeonova, Emilia.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Local policies can have substantial spillovers both across geographies and markets. We estimate U.S. county level direct and spillover effects of Stay-at-Home-Orders (SHOs) aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 on mobility and social interaction measures. We propose a modified difference-in-difference regression design, based on contiguous-county triplets. This approach compares treated counties, which adopted the SHO, and neighbors, to the neighbor's neighbors, which we term hinterland, counties. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declined by a third to a half as much as in the treated locations. These spillover effects are concentrated in neighbors that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we decompose the spillover decline in mobility into reductions in external visits coming from the treated county and an even stronger voluntary decline in the neighbor county's own traffic. Together, our results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and illustrate the quantitative importance of voluntary social distancing. The finding that the estimated spillovers are in the same direction as the direct effects casts doubt on the prevailing narrative that a more nationally coordinated policy response would have accomplished a greater reduction in mobility and contacts.]]></description><author>Elenev, Vadim &amp; Quintero, Luis &amp; Rebucci, Alessandro &amp; Simeonova, Emilia</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16649</guid></item><item><title>Are Housing Prices too Low?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16648</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Michelacci, Claudio & Pozzi, Andrea.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We propose a sufficient statistic to evaluate whether housing prices are inefficiently low for maximizing steady-state household welfare when housing has collateral value. The statistic is based on the insight that at the optimal housing price, the consumption gains
induced by higher housing prices offset the welfare costs of a reduction in housing uses and household leisure. To apply the methodology, we use Italian data over the 1993-2006 period. As a source of exogenous variation for housing prices we rely on a share-shift
instrument exploiting the facts that (i) owing to seminal historical and cultural episodes, foreign nationals have preferences for buying houses in different Italian provinces and (ii) shifts in a country's foreign investment are largely exogenous to the economic performance

We treat the sanctions regime instituted in 2014 against entities in Russia as a quasi-natural experiment. To control for the heterogeneous effects of the ruble devaluation and oil price decline that occurred concurrently with the sanctions regime, we exploit firm-level and sectoral variation in our micro level data set that covers both large firms and SMEs. We find significant negative effects of uncertainty on the response of investment to demand shocks due to the sanctions
regime after isolating the effects of foreign exchange exposure that works through balance sheet channel of the ruble devaluation, the effects of the oil-cost dependence in production as well as of the indirect effects of trade linkages with sanctioning countries on the investment rate.]]></description><author>Altug, Sumru G. &amp; Yesiltas, Sevcan</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16646</guid></item><item><title>The Geography of Job Creation and Job Destruction</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16645</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Kuhn, Moritz & Manovskii, Iourii & Qiu, Xincheng.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Spatial differences in labor market performance are large and highly persistent. Using data from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we document striking similarities in spatial differences in unemployment, vacancies, job finding, and job filling within each country. This robust set of facts guides and disciplines the development of a theory of local labor market performance. We find that a spatial version of a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model with endogenous separations and on-the-job search quantitatively accounts for all the documented empirical regularities.

We focus on 2 x 2 coordination games, which generate multiple equilibria when perception is precise. When adding a small amount of cognitive imprecision to the model, we obtain a unique equilibrium where players use a simple cutoff strategy. The model further predicts that behavior is context-dependent: players implement the unique equilibrium strategy with noise, and the noise decreases in fundamental volatility. Our experimental data strongly support this novel prediction and reject several alternative game-theoretic models that do not predict context-dependence. We also find that subjects are aware of other players' imprecision, which is key to generating strategic uncertainty. Our framework has important implications for the literature on global games and, more broadly, illuminates the role of perception in generating both random and context-dependent behavior in games.]]></description><author>Frydman, Cary &amp; Nunnari, Salvatore</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16644</guid></item><item><title>The Effects of Taxes on Innovation: Theory and Empirical Evidence</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16608</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Stantcheva, Stefanie.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Income taxes are typically set to raise revenues and redistribute income at the lowest possible efficiency costs, which result from the distortions in individual behaviors that taxes entail. Individuals can respond along many margins, such as labor supply, tax avoidance and evasion, and geographic mobility. But one margin that taxes may affect - innovation - is less frequently considered. Conceptually, taxes reduce the expected net returns to innovation inputs and can reduce innovation. Much like other margins of responses to taxes, this efficiency cost must be taken into account. Innovation is done by a relatively small number of people, but it is nevertheless likely to have widespread benefits. While inventors may have divergent motivations, such as social recognition or the love of discovery, they also face an economic reality. How strongly innovation responds to taxes is an empirical question that has been the subject of a growing body of recent work. In this paper, I study how to account for innovation when setting personal income and capital taxation. I distinguish between two cases: one in which the government can set a differentiated tax on inventors and one in which the government is constrained to set the same tax on all agents. I provide a model that flexibly accounts for the spillovers generated by innovation and the non-pecuniary benefits inventors receive from innovation and derive tax formulas expressed in terms of estimable sufficient statistics. The second part of the paper discusses the empirical evidence on the effects of taxes on the quantity, quality, and location of innovation, as well as tax avoidance and income shifting done through innovation.]]></description><author>Stantcheva, Stefanie</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16608</guid></item><item><title>The Insurance Role of the Family</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16591</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Fehr, Hans & Kindermann, Fabian.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Besides love and affection the family also provides economic benefits.

First, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 and policy responses on small and medium sized enterprise (SME) business failures. We combine firm-level financial data from 50 sectors in 27 countries, a detailed I-O network, real-time data on lockdown policies and mobility patterns, and a rich model of firm behavior that allows for several dimensions of heterogeneity. We find: (a) Absent government support, the failure rate of SMEs would have increased by 9 percentage points, significantly more so in emerging market economies (EMs). With policy support it only increased by 4.3 per-centage points, and even decreased in advanced economies (AEs). (b) Fiscal policy was poorly targeted: most of the funds disbursed went to firms who did not need it. (c) Nev-ertheless, we find little evidence of the policy merely postponing mass business failures or creating many 'zombie' firms: failure rates rise only slightly in 2021 once policy support is removed. Next, we build a tractable global intertemporal general equilibrium I-O model with fiscal policy. We calibrate the model to 64 countries and 36 sectors. We find that: (d) a sizeable share of the global economy is demand-constrained under COVID-19, especially so in EMs. (e) Globally, fiscal policy helped offset about 8% of the downturn in COVID, with a low 'traditional' fiscal multiplier. Yet it significantly reduced the share of demand-constrained sectors, preserving employment in these sectors. (f) Fiscal policy exerted small and negative spillovers to output in other countries but positive spillovers on employment.(g) A two-speed recovery would put significant upwards pressure on global interest rates which imposes an additional headwind on the EM recovery.

Then, we compute robot quality by dividing quality-unadjusted prices by the quality-adjusted industrial robot price index produced by the Bank of Japan. Based on the three approaches, significant decline in improvement in the quality of robots in the last decade is found. The differences in the growth rates of robot quality between the 2000s and 2010s show substantially negative values of around -3 percentage points per annum.]]></description><author>Fujiwara, Ippei &amp; Kimoto, Ryo &amp; Shiratsuka, Shigenori &amp; Shirota, Toyoichiro</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16556</guid></item><item><title>Mitigating Climate Change: Growth-Friendly Policies to Achieve Net Zero Emissions by 2050</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16553</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Jaumotte, Florence & Liu, Weifeng & McKibbin, Warwick.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> The paper examines climate mitigation strategies to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century, focusing on smoothing macroeconomic costs in the short- to medium-term-the horizon relevant for policymakers. It explores a comprehensive policy package, which complements carbon pricing with an initial green fiscal stimulus, consisting of green public investment and subsidies to renewables production. Model simulations show that thanks to the green public spending, the policy package boosts global output relative to the baseline for the first 15 years of the low-carbon transition. Subsequent transitional output costs resulting from further increases in carbon prices are moderate of the order of 1 percent of baseline global GDP by 2050. The findings suggest that upfront green fiscal packages could help smooth the transition to a low-carbon economy. In the current context of the Covid-19 economic crisis, they would help support the recovery from the crisis and put the global economy on a greener, more sustainable path.]]></description><author>Jaumotte, Florence &amp; Liu, Weifeng &amp; McKibbin, Warwick</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16553</guid></item><item><title>The Long-Term Effects of Industrial Policy</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16534</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Choi, Jaedo & Levchenko, Andrei A..</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> This paper provides causal evidence of the impact of industrial policy on firms' long-term performance and quantifies industrial policy's long-term welfare effects. Using a natural experiment and unique historical data during the Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) Drive in South Korea, we find large and persistent effects of firm-level subsidies on firm size. Subsidized firms are larger than those never subsidized even 30 years after subsidies ended. Motivated by this empirical finding, we build a quantitative heterogeneous firm model that rationalizes these persistent effects through a combination of learning-by-doing (LBD) and financial frictions that hinder firms from internalizing LBD. The model is calibrated to firm-level micro data, and its key parameters are disciplined with the econometric estimates. Cost-benefit analysis implies that the industrial policy generated larger benefits than costs. If the industrial policy had not been implemented, South Korea's welfare would have been 22-31% lower, depending on how long-lived are the productivity benefits of LBD. Between one-half and two-thirds of the total welfare difference comes from the long-term effects of the policy.]]></description><author>Choi, Jaedo &amp; Levchenko, Andrei A.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16534</guid></item><item><title>The Affordable Care Act After a Decade: Its Impact on the Labor Market and the Macro Economy</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16530</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Fang, Hanming & Krueger, Dirk.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is one of the most important reforms of the US health insurance system since the introduction of Medicare. Since employment is a main source of health insurance for the working age population in the United States, this sweeping health insurance reform also has important implications for the labor market and the macro economy. In this paper, we survey the prototype models that are used in the macro and labor literature, extended to integrate health and health insurance, to study the short- and long-run consequences of the ACA. We also suggest open areas for future research.]]></description><author>Fang, Hanming &amp; Krueger, Dirk</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16530</guid></item><item><title>Harms of AI</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16524</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Acemoglu, Daron.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> This essay discusses several potential economic, political and social costs of the current path of AI technologies. I argue that if AI continues to be deployed along its current trajectory and remains unregulated, it may produce various social, economic and political harms. These include: damaging competition, consumer privacy and consumer choice; excessively automating work, fueling inequality, inefficiently pushing down wages, and failing to improve worker productivity; and damaging political discourse, democracy's most fundamental lifeblood. Although there is no conclusive evidence suggesting that these costs are imminent or substantial, it may be useful to understand them before they are fully realized and become harder or even impossible to reverse, precisely because of AI's promising and wide-reaching potential. I also suggest that these costs are not inherent to the nature of AI technologies, but are related to how they are being used and developed at the moment - to empower corporations and governments against workers and citizens. As a result, efforts to limit and reverse these costs may need to rely on regulation and policies to redirect AI research. Attempts to contain them
just by promoting competition may be insufficient.]]></description><author>Acemoglu, Daron</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16524</guid></item><item><title>Spending a Windfall</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16523</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Palma, Nuno Pedro G. & Silva, André.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> We study the effect of the discovery of precious metals in America on international trade from 1500 to 1810. Around 1500, there was a simultaneous discovery of precious metals and new trading routes. We construct a counterfactual scenario of new routes but no precious metals. The discovery of precious metals was a windfall to Europe. It increased the stock of precious metals in the world more than tenfold. Compared with the case of no trade routes and no precious metals, Euro-Asian trade increases up to 20 times. We find that American precious metals were at least as important as the new trading routes as a cause of observed trade patterns.]]></description><author>Palma, Nuno Pedro G. &amp; Silva, André</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16523</guid></item><item><title>The Neoclassical Model and the Welfare Costs of Selection</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16522</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Collard, Fabrice & Licandro, Omar.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> This paper embeds firm dynamics into the Neoclassical model and provides a simple framework to solve for the transitional dynamics of economies moving towards more selection. As in the Neoclassical model, markets are perfectly competitive, there is only one good and two production factors (capital and labor). At equilibrium, aggregate technology is Neoclassical, but the average quality of capital and the depreciation rate are both endogenous and positively related to selection. At steady state, output per capita and welfare both raise with selection. However, the selection process generates transitional welfare losses that may reduce in around 60% long term (consumption equivalent) welfare gains. The same property is shown to be true in a standard general equilibrium model with entry and fixed production costs.]]></description><author>Collard, Fabrice &amp; Licandro, Omar</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16522</guid></item><item><title>Economics and family structures</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16516</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Baudin, Thomas & De Rock, Bram & Gobbi, Paula.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Household decisions are one of the key elements impacting many dimensions of any economy. In this paper, we review the economic literature on family types, focusing on nuclear, stem, and complex families. We show that family types are heterogeneous across and within countries, both in the past and in present times. We argue that economists have focused too much their analysis on nuclear families, which may limit our capacity to analyze the impact of institutional phenomena or public policies. We establish how each family type could relate to the basic ingredients of standard structural models of household decisions. We believe this overview sets the stage for an interesting research avenue to improve the structural models of household decision making.]]></description><author>Baudin, Thomas &amp; De Rock, Bram &amp; Gobbi, Paula</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16516</guid></item><item><title>Expansionary Austerity: Reallocating Credit Amid Fiscal Consolidation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16511</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Morais, Bernardo & Perez-Estrada, Javier & Peydró, José Luis & Ruiz-Ortega, Claudia.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> We show expansionary fiscal austerity via reallocation of credit supply, but with a raise in poverty.
For identification, we exploit the introduction of a Mexican law limiting the debt of subnational
governments along with matched credit register, firm, bank, and state datasets. After the law,
states with higher ex ante public debt grow substantially faster, despite larger fiscal consolidation
(higher taxes and lower public expenditure). Banks operating in more indebted states reallocate
credit supply away from local governments into private firms, with stronger effects for banks with
higher exposure to local public debt, consistent with lowering crowding out. Effects only happen
after the law, not before, and there are strong firm-level real effects associated. The reduction of
crowding out is stronger for financially constrained firms and for firms operating in states with
higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure projects. In states more
affected by the law, despite better economic effects, extreme poverty increases--especially in
states with higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure--consistent with
a strong reduction for social services during the fiscal consolidation.]]></description><author>Morais, Bernardo &amp; Perez-Estrada, Javier &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Ruiz-Ortega, Claudia</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16511</guid></item></channel></rss>
