The estimated model matches four facts about banks' Tobin's Q that summarize bank leverage dynamics. (1) Book and market equity values diverge, especially during crises; (2) Tobin's Q predicts future bank profitability; (3) neither book nor market leverage constraints are binding for most banks; (4) bank leverage and Tobin's Q are mean reverting but highly persistent.

ERDF has positive short term average consequences on all regional variables, but gains typically dissipate within three years. ESF has insignificant average impact effects, but medium-term multipliers are positive and economically important. There are differential regional transition paths and outlooks for economic transformation. Location, level of development, EU tenure, Euro area membership, and national borders account for the asymmetries. We interpret the facts with an equilibrium model of a monetary union featuring endogenous growth. Structural features and public administration characteristics can explain the observed asymmetries.

closures from Burbio, we quantify the heterogeneous impact of school closures during the
Corona crisis on children affected at different ages and coming from households with different
parental characteristics. Our data suggests that secondary schools were closed for
in-person learning for longer periods than elementary schools (implying that younger children
experienced less school closures than older children), and that private schools experienced
shorter closures than public schools, and schools in poorer U.S. counties experienced
shorter school closures. We then extend the structural life cycle model of private and
public schooling investments studied in Fuchs-SchÃ¼ndeln, Krueger, Ludwig, and Popova
(2021) to include the choice of parents whether to send their children to private schools,
empirically discipline it with data on parental investments from the PSID, and then feed
into the model the school closure measures from our empirical analysis to quantify the
long-run consequences of the Covid-19 school closures on the cohorts of children currently
in school. Future earnings- and welfare losses are largest for children that started public
secondary schools at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. Comparing children from the top to
children from the bottom quartile of the income distribution, welfare losses are ca. 0.8
percentage points larger for the poorer children if school closures were unrelated to income.
Accounting for the longer school closures in richer counties reduces this gap by about 1/3.
A policy intervention that extends schools by 3 months (6 weeks in the next two summers)
generates significant welfare gains for the children and raises future tax revenues approximately
sufficient to pay for the cost of this schooling expansion.]]></description><author>Fuchs-Schündeln, Nicola &amp; Krueger, Dirk &amp; Kurmann, Andre &amp; Lale, Etienne &amp; Ludwig, Alexander &amp; Popova, Irina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16663</guid></item><item><title>Perpetual Motion: Human Mobility and Spatial Frictions in Three African Countries</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16661</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Recent literature points to the importance in developing countries of spatial and sectoral gaps in wages and  living standards. These gaps seemingly imply frictions to human mobility. In this paper, we present new evidence on mobility within three African countries. We use a novel data source that provides highly detailed location data on more than one million smartphone devices across three large African countries for an entire year. This allows us to examine high-frequency mobility patterns for a subset of people for whom we can determine home locations confidently. The data offer insights into patterns of mobility, with corresponding implications for the nature and extent of mobility frictions. In particular, our data point to the ubiquity of relatively high-frequency journeys within countries -- i.e., visits. We observe that many users travel to  relatively distant within-country locations, with big cities acting as particularly attractive magnets. We develop a conceptual framework that characterizes the role of visits for individuals  and provides a number of testable predictions that are consistent with the movement patterns that we observe in the data. The analysis suggests that distance-linked mobility costs are not so high as to discourage travel. In fact, travel enables users to benefit from the opportunities that large cities provide, without having to incur the costs of relocation. The frictions sustaining spatial and sectoral gaps thus seem  to reflect deep fixed costs associated with the dislocations of migration and sectoral change, rather than the direct costs of movement.]]></description><author>Blanchard, Paul &amp; Gollin, Douglas &amp; Kirchberger, Martina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16661</guid></item><item><title>A Safe Harbor: Wealth-Income Ratios in Switzerland Over the 20th Century and the Role of Housing Prices</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16660</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We estimate the ratio of private wealth to national income, Î²pt, for Switzerland over the period 1900â??2018. Our results indicate that the development of Î²pt in Switzerland did not follow a U-shaped pattern as in most European countries, but that the evolution was extraordinarily stable, with Î²pt oscillating around 500% over most of the 20th century. However, the wealth-income ratio has been on the rise since the turn of the century to reach 721% in 2017-a level unprecedented in the past. This considerable increase is mainly driven by large capital gains in housing wealth since 2010. We present new cross-country evidence that capital gains in housing wealth have become an important driver of rising wealth-income ratios in a series of developed economies.]]></description><author>Baselgia, Enea &amp; Martínez, Isabel Z.</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16660</guid></item><item><title>Growing Apart: Declining Within- and Across-Locality Insurance in Rural China</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16654</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We consider risk sharing in rural China during rapid economic transformation from the late 1980s through the late 2000s. We document an erosion of consumption insurance against both household-level idiosyncratic and village-level aggregate income shocks, and show that this decline is related to observable economic changes: the shift from agriculture to wage employment, the decline of publicly owned Township-and-Village Enterprises, and increased migrant work. Further evidence suggests that as these changes took place at the village level, higher levels of government failed to offset these effects through the tax-and-transfer system, leaving households more exposed to both idiosyncratic and village-aggregate shocks.]]></description><author>Attanasio, Orazio &amp; Meghir, Costas &amp; Mommaerts, Corina &amp; Zheng, Yu</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16654</guid></item><item><title>Post-Corona Balanced-Budget Super-Stimulus: The Case for Shifting Taxes onto Land</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16652</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> The post-Corona economic environment puts a premium on finding fiscal means to stimulate the economy while continuing to finance current levels of expenditures and debt. We develop and carefully calibrate a model of the US economy to show that an increase in the tax rate on the value of land, balanced by decreases in the tax rates on the incomes of capital and labor, can meet this need. We find that the US share of land in total nonfinancial assets is more than 50%, so that the tax base is very large. This is corroborated by very high quality OECD data for other industrialized economies that, almost without exception, find land shares of between 40% and 60%. Our baseline proposed tax reform is an increase in the tax rate on the asset value of land from its current 0.55% to 5.55%, accompanied by reductions in tax rates on capital and labor incomes of 28 and 10 percentage points, respectively. In a representative household model, this increases welfare by 3.4% of steady state consumption, and increases output by almost 15% relative to trend. In an economy with separate groups of workers, capitalists and landlords, the output gain is the same, while the welfare gain increases to 6.4% on average across the three groups. Welfare and output gains for a wealth tax that raises the same revenue, and which increases the tax rates on capital and land equally, are only half as large as the baseline. Welfare and output gains for an optimal tax reform, under the assumption that the tax rate on the value of land is capped at 20%, are approximately twice as large as the baseline. This reform raises 55% of all tax revenue through land taxes, with the remaining 45% raised through consumption taxes, while all income taxes are abolished.]]></description><author>Goodhart, Charles A &amp; Hudson, Michael &amp; Kumhof, Michael &amp; Tideman, Nicolaus</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16652</guid></item><item><title>Direct and Spillover Effects from Staggered Adoption of Health Policies: Evidence from Covid-19 Stay-at-Home Orders</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16649</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Local policies can have substantial spillovers both across geographies and markets. We estimate U.S. county level direct and spillover effects of Stay-at-Home-Orders (SHOs) aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 on mobility and social interaction measures. We propose a modified difference-in-difference regression design, based on contiguous-county triplets. This approach compares treated counties, which adopted the SHO, and neighbors, to the neighbor's neighbors, which we term hinterland, counties. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declined by a third to a half as much as in the treated locations. These spillover effects are concentrated in neighbors that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we decompose the spillover decline in mobility into reductions in external visits coming from the treated county and an even stronger voluntary decline in the neighbor county's own traffic. Together, our results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and illustrate the quantitative importance of voluntary social distancing. The finding that the estimated spillovers are in the same direction as the direct effects casts doubt on the prevailing narrative that a more nationally coordinated policy response would have accomplished a greater reduction in mobility and contacts.]]></description><author>Elenev, Vadim &amp; Quintero, Luis &amp; Rebucci, Alessandro &amp; Simeonova, Emilia</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16649</guid></item><item><title>Are Housing Prices too Low?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16648</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We propose a sufficient statistic to evaluate whether housing prices are inefficiently low for maximizing steady-state household welfare when housing has collateral value. The statistic is based on the insight that at the optimal housing price, the consumption gains
induced by higher housing prices offset the welfare costs of a reduction in housing uses and household leisure. To apply the methodology, we use Italian data over the 1993-2006 period. As a source of exogenous variation for housing prices we rely on a share-shift
instrument exploiting the facts that (i) owing to seminal historical and cultural episodes, foreign nationals have preferences for buying houses in different Italian provinces and (ii) shifts in a country's foreign investment are largely exogenous to the economic performance
of specific Italian provinces. The data indicate that higher housing prices increase local consumption more than they decrease leisure and housing use by locals, suggesting that housing prices were inefficiently low.]]></description><author>Michelacci, Claudio &amp; Pozzi, Andrea</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16648</guid></item><item><title>Marketization and the Fertility of Highly Educated Women along the Extensive and Intensive Margins</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16647</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> This paper  documents a convergence in fertility rates along the extensive and intensive margins between  women with advanced degrees and other women over the last four decades in the U.S. It then estimates the effect of the cost of home production substitutes on fertility in the extensive and intensive margins, and allows this effect to vary by women's educational group. The decline in thee cost of home production substitutes, relative to a highly educated woman's own wage can explain 11.9% of the increase in the number of own children in the household. When looking separately at the intensive and extensive margins, it finds that the decline in relative childcare cost can account for 6.6% of the increase in fertility in the intensive margin and  16.1% of the decline in childlessness rates of women with advanced degrees.]]></description><author>Hazan, Moshe &amp; Weiss, David &amp; Zoabi, Hosny</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16647</guid></item><item><title>Investment under Stormy Skies: The Case of Russian Firms during 2004-2016</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16646</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> In this study, we quantify the effects of uncertainty on investment decisions for the Russian economy. We employ an empirical specification where the dynamics of investment under uncertainty are captured by an error correction model of investment. We use a rich panel of Russian
non-financial firms which is uniquely suited to studying investment in Russia over the period 2004-2016. We treat the sanctions regime instituted in 2014 against entities in Russia as a quasi-natural experiment. To control for the heterogeneous effects of the ruble devaluation and oil price decline that occurred concurrently with the sanctions regime, we exploit firm-level and sectoral variation in our micro level data set that covers both large firms and SMEs. We find significant negative effects of uncertainty on the response of investment to demand shocks due to the sanctions
regime after isolating the effects of foreign exchange exposure that works through balance sheet channel of the ruble devaluation, the effects of the oil-cost dependence in production as well as of the indirect effects of trade linkages with sanctioning countries on the investment rate.]]></description><author>Altug, Sumru G. &amp; Yesiltas, Sevcan</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16646</guid></item><item><title>The Geography of Job Creation and Job Destruction</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16645</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Spatial differences in labor market performance are large and highly persistent. Using data from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we document striking similarities in spatial differences in unemployment, vacancies, job finding, and job filling within each country. This robust set of facts guides and disciplines the development of a theory of local labor market performance. We find that a spatial version of a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model with endogenous separations and on-the-job search quantitatively accounts for all the documented empirical regularities. The model also quantitatively rationalizes why differences in job-separation rates have primary importance in
inducing differences in unemployment across space while changes in the job-finding rate are the main driver in unemployment fluctuations over the business cycle.]]></description><author>Kuhn, Moritz &amp; Manovskii, Iourii &amp; Qiu, Xincheng</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16645</guid></item><item><title>Cognitive Imprecision and Strategic Behavior</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16644</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We propose and experimentally test a theory of strategic behavior in which players are cognitively imprecise and perceive a fundamental parameter with noise. We focus on 2 x 2 coordination games, which generate multiple equilibria when perception is precise. When adding a small amount of cognitive imprecision to the model, we obtain a unique equilibrium where players use a simple cutoff strategy. The model further predicts that behavior is context-dependent: players implement the unique equilibrium strategy with noise, and the noise decreases in fundamental volatility. Our experimental data strongly support this novel prediction and reject several alternative game-theoretic models that do not predict context-dependence. We also find that subjects are aware of other players' imprecision, which is key to generating strategic uncertainty. Our framework has important implications for the literature on global games and, more broadly, illuminates the role of perception in generating both random and context-dependent behavior in games.]]></description><author>Frydman, Cary &amp; Nunnari, Salvatore</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16644</guid></item><item><title>The Effects of Taxes on Innovation: Theory and Empirical Evidence</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16608</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Income taxes are typically set to raise revenues and redistribute income at the lowest possible efficiency costs, which result from the distortions in individual behaviors that taxes entail. Individuals can respond along many margins, such as labor supply, tax avoidance and evasion, and geographic mobility. But one margin that taxes may affect - innovation - is less frequently considered. Conceptually, taxes reduce the expected net returns to innovation inputs and can reduce innovation. Much like other margins of responses to taxes, this efficiency cost must be taken into account. Innovation is done by a relatively small number of people, but it is nevertheless likely to have widespread benefits. While inventors may have divergent motivations, such as social recognition or the love of discovery, they also face an economic reality. How strongly innovation responds to taxes is an empirical question that has been the subject of a growing body of recent work. In this paper, I study how to account for innovation when setting personal income and capital taxation. I distinguish between two cases: one in which the government can set a differentiated tax on inventors and one in which the government is constrained to set the same tax on all agents. I provide a model that flexibly accounts for the spillovers generated by innovation and the non-pecuniary benefits inventors receive from innovation and derive tax formulas expressed in terms of estimable sufficient statistics. The second part of the paper discusses the empirical evidence on the effects of taxes on the quantity, quality, and location of innovation, as well as tax avoidance and income shifting done through innovation.]]></description><author>Stantcheva, Stefanie</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16608</guid></item><item><title>The Insurance Role of the Family</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16591</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Besides love and affection the family also provides economic benefits. Beyond gains from specialization and economies of scale, it serves as a provider of insurance against various risks individuals face throughout their life. This insurance role of the family has changed during past decades owing to several factors: a fundamental transition in the gender wage gap and female labor force participation, the legal framework, and the dynamics of household formation over the life cycle.

We argue that democratisation is not a discrete event but a two-stage process: autocracies first enter into 'episodes' of political liberalization;  in the second stage, these episodes either culminate in regime change or not. Failure to account for this chronology and the implicit counterfactual groups risks biased estimates due to selection effects. Adopting a repeated-treatment difference-in-difference implementation, which captures non-parallel trends and selection into treatment, we find that a single event approach substantially underestimates the economic dividends from regime change and, crucially, obscures the permanent growth effect of democratisation.]]></description><author>Boese, Vanessa &amp; Eberhardt, Markus</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16587</guid></item><item><title>Fiscal Policy in the Age of COVID: Does it 'Get in all of the Cracks?'</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16576</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We study the effects of fiscal policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic at the firm, sector, country and global level. First, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 and policy responses on small and medium sized enterprise (SME) business failures. We combine firm-level financial data from 50 sectors in 27 countries, a detailed I-O network, real-time data on lockdown policies and mobility patterns, and a rich model of firm behavior that allows for several dimensions of heterogeneity. We find: (a) Absent government support, the failure rate of SMEs would have increased by 9 percentage points, significantly more so in emerging market economies (EMs). With policy support it only increased by 4.3 per-centage points, and even decreased in advanced economies (AEs). (b) Fiscal policy was poorly targeted: most of the funds disbursed went to firms who did not need it. (c) Nev-ertheless, we find little evidence of the policy merely postponing mass business failures or creating many 'zombie' firms: failure rates rise only slightly in 2021 once policy support is removed. Next, we build a tractable global intertemporal general equilibrium I-O model with fiscal policy. We calibrate the model to 64 countries and 36 sectors. We find that: (d) a sizeable share of the global economy is demand-constrained under COVID-19, especially so in EMs. (e) Globally, fiscal policy helped offset about 8% of the downturn in COVID, with a low 'traditional' fiscal multiplier. Yet it significantly reduced the share of demand-constrained sectors, preserving employment in these sectors. (f) Fiscal policy exerted small and negative spillovers to output in other countries but positive spillovers on employment.(g) A two-speed recovery would put significant upwards pressure on global interest rates which imposes an additional headwind on the EM recovery. (h) Corporate and sovereign spreads rise when global rates increase, suggesting that EM may face challenging external funding conditions as AEs economies normalize.]]></description><author>Gourinchas, Pierre-Olivier &amp; Kalemli-Ozcan, Sebnem &amp; Penciakova, Veronika &amp; Sander, Nick</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16576</guid></item><item><title>The Rise of the Educated Class</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16572</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Recent decades have seen dramatic developments in Western countries, which happened in a number of areas, political, economic and social.

Then, we compute robot quality by dividing quality-unadjusted prices by the quality-adjusted industrial robot price index produced by the Bank of Japan.

It explores a comprehensive policy package, which complements carbon pricing with an initial green fiscal stimulus, consisting of green public investment and subsidies to renewables production. Model simulations show that thanks to the green public spending, the policy package boosts global output relative to the baseline for the first 15 years of the low-carbon transition. Subsequent transitional output costs resulting from further increases in carbon prices are moderate of the order of 1 percent of baseline global GDP by 2050. The findings suggest that upfront green fiscal packages could help smooth the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Using a natural experiment and unique historical data during the Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) Drive in South Korea, we find large and persistent effects of firm-level subsidies on firm size. Subsidized firms are larger than those never subsidized even 30 years after subsidies ended. Motivated by this empirical finding, we build a quantitative heterogeneous firm model that rationalizes these persistent effects through a combination of learning-by-doing (LBD) and financial frictions that hinder firms from internalizing LBD. The model is calibrated to firm-level micro data, and its key parameters are disciplined with the econometric estimates. Cost-benefit analysis implies that the industrial policy generated larger benefits than costs. If the industrial policy had not been implemented, South Korea's welfare would have been 22-31% lower, depending on how long-lived are the productivity benefits of LBD. Between one-half and two-thirds of the total welfare difference comes from the long-term effects of the policy.]]></description><author>Choi, Jaedo &amp; Levchenko, Andrei A.</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16534</guid></item><item><title>The Affordable Care Act After a Decade: Its Impact on the Labor Market and the Macro Economy</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16530</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is one of the most important reforms of the US health insurance system since the introduction of Medicare. Since employment is a main source of health insurance for the working age population in the United States, this sweeping health insurance reform also has important implications for the labor market and the macro economy. In this paper, we survey the prototype models that are used in the macro and labor literature, extended to integrate health and health insurance, to study the short- and long-run consequences of the ACA. We also suggest open areas for future research.]]></description><author>Fang, Hanming &amp; Krueger, Dirk</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16530</guid></item><item><title>Harms of AI</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16524</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> This essay discusses several potential economic, political and social costs of the current path of AI technologies. I argue that if AI continues to be deployed along its current trajectory and remains unregulated, it may produce various social, economic and political harms. These include: damaging competition, consumer privacy and consumer choice; excessively automating work, fueling inequality, inefficiently pushing down wages, and failing to improve worker productivity; and damaging political discourse, democracy's most fundamental lifeblood. Although there is no conclusive evidence suggesting that these costs are imminent or substantial, it may be useful to understand them before they are fully realized and become harder or even impossible to reverse, precisely because of AI's promising and wide-reaching potential. I also suggest that these costs are not inherent to the nature of AI technologies, but are related to how they are being used and developed at the moment - to empower corporations and governments against workers and citizens. As a result, efforts to limit and reverse these costs may need to rely on regulation and policies to redirect AI research. Attempts to contain them
just by promoting competition may be insufficient.]]></description><author>Acemoglu, Daron</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16524</guid></item><item><title>Spending a Windfall</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16523</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We study the effect of the discovery of precious metals in America on international trade from 1500 to 1810. Around 1500, there was a simultaneous discovery of precious metals and new trading routes. We construct a counterfactual scenario of new routes but no precious metals. The discovery of precious metals was a windfall to Europe. It increased the stock of precious metals in the world more than tenfold. Compared with the case of no trade routes and no precious metals, Euro-Asian trade increases up to 20 times.

As in the Neoclassical model, markets are perfectly competitive, there is only one good and two production factors (capital and labor). At equilibrium, aggregate technology is Neoclassical, but the average quality of capital and the depreciation rate are both endogenous and positively related to selection. At steady state, output per capita and welfare both raise with selection. However, the selection process generates transitional welfare losses that may reduce in around 60% long term (consumption equivalent) welfare gains. The same property is shown to be true in a standard general equilibrium model with entry and fixed production costs.]]></description><author>Collard, Fabrice &amp; Licandro, Omar</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16522</guid></item><item><title>Economics and family structures</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16516</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Household decisions are one of the key elements impacting many dimensions of any economy. In this paper, we review the economic literature on family types, focusing on nuclear, stem, and complex families. We show that family types are heterogeneous across and within countries, both in the past and in present times. We argue that economists have focused too much their analysis on nuclear families, which may limit our capacity to analyze the impact of institutional phenomena or public policies. We establish how each family type could relate to the basic ingredients of standard structural models of household decisions. We believe this overview sets the stage for an interesting research avenue to improve the structural models of household decision making.]]></description><author>Baudin, Thomas &amp; De Rock, Bram &amp; Gobbi, Paula</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16516</guid></item><item><title>Expansionary Austerity: Reallocating Credit Amid Fiscal Consolidation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16511</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We show expansionary fiscal austerity via reallocation of credit supply, but with a raise in poverty.
For identification, we exploit the introduction of a Mexican law limiting the debt of subnational
governments along with matched credit register, firm, bank, and state datasets. After the law,
states with higher ex ante public debt grow substantially faster, despite larger fiscal consolidation
(higher taxes and lower public expenditure). Banks operating in more indebted states reallocate
credit supply away from local governments into private firms, with stronger effects for banks with
higher exposure to local public debt, consistent with lowering crowding out. Effects only happen
after the law, not before, and there are strong firm-level real effects associated. The reduction of
crowding out is stronger for financially constrained firms and for firms operating in states with
higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure projects. In states more
affected by the law, despite better economic effects, extreme poverty increases--especially in
states with higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure--consistent with
a strong reduction for social services during the fiscal consolidation.]]></description><author>Morais, Bernardo &amp; Perez-Estrada, Javier &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Ruiz-Ortega, Claudia</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16511</guid></item><item><title>Organizational capacity and profit shifting</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16502</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> This paper analyses the effect of a firm's organizational capacity on the reported profitability of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Better organizational practices improve productivity and the potential taxable profits of firms. However, higher adoption of these practices may also enable more efficient allocation of profits across tax jurisdictions, lowering actual taxable profits. We present new evidence that MNE subsidiaries with better such practices, when located in high-tax countries, report significantly lower profits and have a higher incidence of bunching around zero returns on assets. We show these results are driven by patterns consistent with profit-shifting behavior. Further, using an event study design, we find that firms with better practices are more responsive to corporate tax rate changes. Our results suggest organizational capacity, especially monitoring-related practices, enables firms to engage in shifting profits away from their high-tax subsidiaries.]]></description><author>Bilicka, Katarzyna &amp; Scur, Daniela</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16502</guid></item><item><title>Play for the Rich and Work for the Poor?

With a U.S. calibration, the planner raises total savings but not hours, driving up aggregate wages which re-distributes income toward the consumption-poor. Across the distribution, the productive (high wage earners) should save more; the wealthy should work more; the poor should keep their work hours unchanged and take advantage of the indirect transfers from higher wages.]]></description><author>Shanker, Akshay &amp; Wolf, Martin</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16479</guid></item><item><title>Productivity slowdown: reducing the measure of our ignorance</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16478</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Growth accounting suggests that the bulk of the  post-2004 slowdown in output growth in the U.S. is  attributed to a residual called TFP.

In this paper, we analyze the migration response of American workers to two of the most important shocks that hit US manufacturing since the late 1990s - Chinese import competition and the introduction of industrial robots. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in exposure across US local labor markets over time, we show that robots caused a sizable reduction in population size, while Chinese imports did not. We rationalize these results in two steps. First, we provide evidence that negative employment spillovers outside manufacturing, caused by robots but not by Chinese imports, are an important mechanism for the different migration responses triggered by the two shocks. Next, we present a model where workers are geographically mobile and compete with either machines or foreign labor in the completion of tasks. The model highlights that two key dimensions along which the shocks differ - the cost savings they provide and the degree of complementarity between directly and indirectly exposed industries - can explain their disparate employment effects outside manufacturing and, in turn, the differential migration response.]]></description><author>Faber, Marius &amp; Sarto, Andres &amp; Tabellini, Marco</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16460</guid></item><item><title>Oil Price Shocks and Conflict Escalation: Onshore vs. Offshore</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16454</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We reconsider the relationship between oil and conflict, focusing on the location of oil resources.

We use a model to illustrate how these opposite effects can be explained by a fighting capacity mechanism, whereby the government can use offshore oil income to increase its fighting capacity, while onshore oil may be looted by oppositional groups to finance a rebellion. We provide empirical evidence supporting this interpretation: we find that oil price windfalls increase both the number and strength of active rebel groups in onshore-rich countries, while they strengthen the government in offshore-rich ones.]]></description><author>Juel Andersen, Jørgen &amp; Nordvik, Frode Martin &amp; Tesei, Andrea</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16454</guid></item><item><title>OECD Pension Reform: it is the business cycle, not the demography!</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16451</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Using a new real-time dataset from Beetsma et al.

Quantitative analyses show that norms explain 49% of the variation in fertility and 31% of the variation in investment in the education of children among the households that differ in the mother's educational background and social class. The influence of norms is the weakest in households where women have tertiary education. The policies that provide economic incentives to encourage the education of children and control the population growth are less effective in the presence of norms. The cost of these policies is substantially lower when households are unaffected by norms, and the decline in cost varies with the education of the mothers in the target households.]]></description><author>Iftikhar, Zainab</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16445</guid></item><item><title>The Effects of Biased Labor Market Expectations on Consumption, Wealth Inequality, and Welfare</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16444</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Idiosyncratic labor risk is a prevalent phenomenon with important implications for individual choices. In labor market research it is commonly assumed that agents have rational expectations and therefore they correctly assess the risk they face in the labor market. We analyze survey data for the U.S. and document a substantial optimistic bias of households in their subjective expectations about future labor market transitions. Furthermore, we analyze the heterogeneity in the bias across different demographic groups and we find that high-school graduates tend to be vastly over-optimistic about their labor market prospects, whereas college graduates have rather precise beliefs. In the context of a quantitative heterogenous agents lifecycle model we show that the optimistic bias has a quantitatively sizable negative effect on the life-cycle allocation of income, consumption and wealth and implies a substantial loss in individual welfare compared to the allocation under full information. Moreover, we establish that the heterogeneity in the bias leads to pronounced differences in the accumulation of assets across individuals, and is thereby a quantitatively important driver of inequality in wealth.]]></description><author>Balleer, Almut &amp; Duernecker, Georg &amp; Forstner, Susanne &amp; Goensch, Johannes</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16444</guid></item><item><title>Monetary Policy in the Age of Automation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16416</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We provide a framework in which monetary policy affects firms' automation decisions (i.e. how intensively capital and labor are used in production).

Monetary expansions can increase output by inducing firms to invest and automate more, while having little impact on inflation and employment. A protracted period of weak demand might translate into less investment and de-automation, rather than into deflation and involuntary unemployment. Running the economy hot, through expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, may have a positive long run impact on labor productivity and wages.

We propose a new method to measure the effect of censorship on knowledge growth,  accounting for the endogenous selection of agents into compliant vs. non-compliant ideas. We apply our method to the Catholic Church's censorship of books written by members of Italian universities and academies over the period 1400-1750. We highlight two new facts: once censorship was introduced, censored authors were of better quality than the non-censored authors, but this gap shrunk over time, and the intensity of censorship decreased over time. These facts are used to identify the deep parameters of a novel endogenous growth model linking censorship to knowledge diffusion and occupational choice. We conclude that censorship reduced by 30% the average log publication per scholar in Italy. Interestingly, half of this drop stems from the induced reallocation of talents towards compliant activities, while the other half arises from the direct effect of censorship on book availability.]]></description><author>Blasutto, Fabio &amp; de la Croix, David</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16409</guid></item><item><title>The Risks of Safe Assets</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16407</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> How much safety and liquidity can the US government provide? Should it accommodate demand for these attributes because high convenience yields in Treasuries lower its borrowing cost? We evaluate a novel fiscal risk channel limiting the government's capacity to issue debt through the lens of a general equilibrium asset pricing model with a rich fiscal sector. Expanding safe asset supply lowers safety premia and improves liquidity in financial markets, but creates  tax and consumption volatility, raising risk premia, credit spreads, and firms' cost of capital. Our  model predicts that this risk channel leads to depressed growth prospects, rising Treasury yields, and elevated consumption risk, for which we find strong empirical evidence. We use our model to quantitatively evaluate current proposals on stimulus and stabilization packages and find that the risk channel is exacerbated in times of fiscal stress. Increasing safe asset supply can thus be risky, and have a significant fiscal cost.]]></description><author>Liu, Yang &amp; Schmid, Lukas &amp; Yaron, Amir</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16407</guid></item><item><title>Carbon Taxation and Inflation: Evidence from the European and Canadian Experience</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16396</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> What is the effect of climate policies on inflation and economic activity?

Based on two separate empirical approaches, we find that carbon taxes do not have to be inflationary and may even have deflationary effects. In particular, our evidence suggests that the increase in energy prices was more than offset by a fall in the prices of services and other non-tradables. Our results are robust for Europe and Canada, as well as a number of different country groupings.

Using confidential Census plant-level data, we show that large manufacturing plant openings not only raise the productivity of local plants but also of distant plants hundreds of miles away, which belong to multi-region firms that are exposed to the local productivity spillover through one of their plants. To quantify the significance of plant-level networks for the propagation and amplification of local productivity shocks, we develop and estimate a quantitative spatial model in which plants of multi-region firms are linked through shared knowledge. Our model features heterogeneous regions, which interact through goods trade and labor markets, as well as within-location, across-plant heterogeneity in productivity, wages, and employment. Counterfactual exercises show that while knowledge sharing through plant-level networks amplifies the aggregate effects of local productivity shocks, it widens economic disparities between individual workers and regions in the economy.]]></description><author>Giroud, Xavier &amp; Lenzu, Simone &amp; Maingi, Quinn &amp; Mueller, Holger M</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16388</guid></item><item><title>Pandemic Lockdown: The Role of Government Commitment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16384</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This paper studies lockdown policy in a dynamic economy without government commitment. Lockdown imposes a cap on labor supply, which improves health prospects at the cost of economic output and consumption. A government would like to commit to the extent of future lockdowns in order to guarantee an economic outlook that supports efficient levels of investment into intermediate inputs. However, such a commitment is not credible, since investments are sunk at the time when the government chooses a lockdown. As a result, lockdown under lack of commitment deviates from the optimal policy. Rules that limit a government's lockdown discretion can improve social welfare, even in the presence of noncontractible information. Quantitatively, lack of commitment causes lockdown to be significantly more severe than is socially optimal. The output and consumption loss due to lack of commitment is greater for higher intermediate input shares, higher discount rates, higher values of life, higher disease transmission rates at and outside of work, and longer vaccine arrival times.]]></description><author>Moser, Christian &amp; Yared, Pierre</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16384</guid></item><item><title>The Gender Pay Gap: Micro Sources and Macro Consequences</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16383</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We document that a large share of the gender pay gap in Brazil is due to women working at lower-paying employers.

In contrast, we show that a well-designed reform of the pension system has the potential to encourage labor force participation. We propose a progressive pension component linked to the employment decision of households,  which implicitly subsidizes employment of the productivity poor.
