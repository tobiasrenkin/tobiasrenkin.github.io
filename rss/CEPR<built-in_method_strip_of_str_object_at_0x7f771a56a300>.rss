Labor market experience cannot easily overcome the discrimination that female doctors suffer. Further, we find that gender discrimination is greater for lower caste doctors, who typically suffer from caste discrimination. Given the increasing share of professionals from a lower caste background, our results suggest that the 'intersectionality' between gender and caste leads to increased gender inequality among professionals in India]]></description><author>Yves Zenou Liang Choon Wang Soubhagya Sahoo Debayan Pakrashi Asadul Islam</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16736</guid></item></channel></rss>
