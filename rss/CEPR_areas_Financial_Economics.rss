We find that the market expected the court ruling to benefit creditors: bond (equity) prices of companies affected by the new rule responded positively (negatively). We attribute this to the ability of creditors to initiate bankruptcy procedures earlier than in the period before the court ruling. We also observe a pronounced increase in the reported net worth of the firms affected by the new rule. We find evidence suggesting that some firms affected by the new rule increased their net worth by raising more equity. We also find, however, that firms changed their accounting practices, as reflected by an increase in long-term discretionary accruals and a decrease in accounting conservatism. As a result of these accounting changes, we document a decline in the informativeness of the treated firms' financial reports. We conclude that the benefits from creditor control rights may be mitigated by unintended consequences in the form of increased incentives for firms to adopt aggressive accounting practices and, as a result, a reduction in the informativeness of firms' financial reporting.]]></description><author>Yishay Yafeh, Nadav Steinberg, Ruth Rooz, Yevgeny Mugerman, Assaf Hamdani</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16844</guid></item><item><title>Banking Regulation (Long) before Basel: Evidence from Discount Limits at the Austro-Hungarian Bank</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16841</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Clemens Jobst, Kilian Rieder.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> We show that central banks used credit limits for discount window loans as a means to enforce supervisory standards at a time when they had no formal regulatory powers.

We show that
under homogeneous beliefs about future cash-flows, FVA regime is superior with greater ex-ante financing, even during periods of high market illiquidity, when the failure of some banks leads to adverse spillovers on surviving financial institutions. However, if disclosures under the FVA regime leads to distorted beliefs about future success probabilities, ex-ante financing may suffer under the FVA regime, and
it may no longer be superior relative to the HCA regime.

We then examine implications of the model regarding the time-series skewness of activity at the sector level, cyclicality of dispersion and skewness across sectors, and the conditional covariances of sector growth rates, finding support for each in the data. The empirical skewness of employment growth, industrial production growth, and stock returns increases with the level of aggregation, which is consistent with the model's implication that it is the nonlinearity in the production structure of the economy that generates the skewness.

We find that higher financial development fosters firm creation and firm expansion, which increases labor demand and leads to higher average wages, especially for cities initially located in banking deserts. The gains produced by higher financial development are not shared equally, but instead monotonically increase with workers' productivity, which leads to a substantial increase in inequality.

This paper develops a general framework to estimate the time-varying risk premium of a state-contingent sovereign debt instrument. Our estimation framework applied to GDP-linked warrants issued by Argentina, Greece, and Ukraine reveals three stylized facts: (i) the risk premium in state-contingent
instruments is high and persistent; (ii) the risk premium exhibits a pro-cyclical pattern; and (iii) the liquidity premium is higher and more volatile than that for plain-vanilla government bonds issued by the same sovereign. We then present a model in which investors fear ambiguity and that can account for the cyclical properties of the risk premium.]]></description><author>Antoine Levy, Taehoon Kim, Deniz Igan</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16795</guid></item><item><title>The Financial Origins of Non-Fundamental Risk</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16793</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Sanjay R.

Households' desire to hedge against price volatility can generate price volatility in equilibrium, even absent fundamental risk. Fearing that asset prices may fall, risk-averse households demand safe assets from leveraged intermediaries, whose issuance of safe assets exposes the economy to self-fulfilling fire sales. Policy can eliminate non-fundamental risk by (i) increasing the supply of publicly backed safe assets, through issuing government debt or bailing out intermediaries, or (ii) reducing the demand for safe assets, through social insurance or by acting as a market maker of last resort.]]></description><author>Sanjay R.

We use our model to estimate the welfare effects of a large enforcement crackdown that occurred during our sample period. The crackdown raised interest rates, lowered the volume of loans, and lowered the welfare of borrowers. The welfare of lenders that conduct harassment more frequently fell, but less-harsh lenders gained through the higher interest rates. We compare this strategy to an alternative policy of targeting borrowers. We find that targeting borrowers with medium ability to repay is more effective at lowering lender welfare than targeting those with low or high repayment ability.]]></description><author>Christoph Walsh, Nicola Pavanini, Huailu Li, Kaiwen Leong</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16779</guid></item><item><title>Carbon Emissions and the Bank-Lending Channel</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16778</link><description><![CDATA[<i>JosÃ© Luis PeydrÃ³, Marcin Kacperczyk.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> We study how firm-level carbon emissions affect bank lending and, through this channel, real, financial, and environmental outcomes in a sample of global firms with syndicated loans. For identification, we use bank-level commitments to carbon neutrality to proxy for changes in banks' green preferences and, via these bank commitments, shocks to firms with previous credit from these banks. We find that firms with higher (lower) scope-1 emission levels previously borrowing from banks making commitments subsequently receive less (more) total bank credit. The economic mechanism at play is bank credit supply, and results are consistent with bank preferences for green rather than differential response to an increased firm risk. The reduction in bank lending to brown firms triggers the reduction in these firms' total debt, leverage, total assets, and real investments. The effects are non-linear, with a strong cut (increase) in lending and investments for brown (green) firms, and mild effects for other firms. Despite the real and financial effects, we find no improvement in hard firm-level environmental scores for brown firms, but only evidence consistent with firms' greenwashing. Overall, our results suggest that banks affect carbon emissions via credit reallocation (from brown to green firms) rather than via providing loans to brown firms for the investment necessary to reduce carbon emissions.]]></description><author>JosÃ© Luis PeydrÃ³, Marcin Kacperczyk</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16778</guid></item><item><title>Identifying Empty Creditors with a Shock and Micro-Data</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16773</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Steven Ongena, Kuchulain O'Flynn, Yalin GÃ¼ndÃ¼z, Hans Degryse.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> Firms with credit-default swaps (CDS) traded on their debt may face "empty creditors" as hedged creditors have less incentive to participate in firm restructuring. We test for the existence of empty creditors by employing an exogenous change to the bankruptcy code in Germany that effectively removes their potential impact on CDS firms. Using a unique dataset on bank-firm CDS net notional and credit exposures we find that the probability of default for CDS firms drops when the effect of empty creditors is removed. This effect increases in the average CDS hedge position of a firm's creditors and in the concentration of the firm's debt. Firms with longer credit relationships, with higher average collateral ratios of their debt, and financially safer firms are less affected by empty creditors. Banks that are not capital constrained and that are liquidity constrained embed the empty creditor effect into their probability of default estimates of affected firms to a larger extent. So do banks that monitor their creditors less and that earn a smaller portion of their income from interest activities.]]></description><author>Steven Ongena, Kuchulain O'Flynn, Yalin GÃ¼ndÃ¼z, Hans Degryse</author><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16773</guid></item><item><title>Distributed Ledgers and the Governance of Money</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16752</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Cyril Monnet, Hyun Song Shin, Raphael Auer.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> Blockchain technology breathes new life into the classical analysis of money as a substitute for a ledger of all past transactions. While it involves updating the ledger through a decentralized consensus on the unique truth, the robustness of the equilibrium that supports this consensus depends on who has access to the ledger and how it can be updated. To find the optimal solution, Buterin's "scalability trilemma" needs to be addressed, so that a workable balance can be found between decentralization, security (i.e. a robust consensus), and scale (the efficient volume of transactions). Using a global game analysis of an exchange economy with credit, we solve for the optimal ledger design that balances the three objectives of this trilemma. We characterize the optimal number of validators, supermajority threshold, fees and transaction size. When intertemporal incentives are strong, a centralized ledger is always optimal. Otherwise, decentralization may be optimal, and validators need to be selected from the set of users of the system.]]></description><author>Cyril Monnet, Hyun Song Shin, Raphael Auer</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16752</guid></item><item><title>Non-Standard Errors</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16751</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Christian C P Wolff, Utz Weitzel, Michael Razen, Sebastian NeusÃ¼ess, Michael Kirchler, Magnus Johannesson, Juergen Huber, Felix Holzmeister, Anna Dreber, Albert Menkveld.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> In statistics, samples are drawn from a population in a data generating process (DGP).

Through panel regressions and local projection analysis, we find that an increase in global financial risk causes a large and persistent widening of sovereign bond spreads.
