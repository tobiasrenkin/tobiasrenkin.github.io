We use our model to estimate the welfare effects of a large enforcement crackdown that occurred during our sample period. The crackdown raised interest rates, lowered the volume of loans, and lowered the welfare of borrowers. The welfare of lenders that conduct harassment more frequently fell, but less-harsh lenders gained through the higher interest rates. We compare this strategy to an alternative policy of targeting borrowers. We find that targeting borrowers with medium ability to repay is more effective at lowering lender welfare than targeting those with low or high repayment ability.]]></description><author>Christoph Walsh Nicola Pavanini Huailu Li Kaiwen Leong</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16779</guid></item></channel></rss>
