of the US labor market with aggregate productivity shocks. Those microfoundations are consistent
with evidence regarding the underlying distribution of firm growth rates across firms
[by age and size] and, when aggregated, are consistent with macro-evidence regarding gross
job creation and job destruction flows over the cycle. By additionally incorporating on-the-job
search, we systematically characterise the stochastic relationships between aggregate job creation
and job destruction flows across firms, gross hire and quit flows [churning] by workers
across firms, as well as the persistence and volatility of unemployment and worker job finding
rates over the cycle.]]></description><author>Melvyn G Coles Alex Clymo Carlos Carrillo-Tudela</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16733</guid></item></channel></rss>
