difference-in-differences estimates on sectoral and regional data suggest had Norway chosen
deeper integration, the average Norwegian region would have experienced an increase

We find that the program increased public employment and reduced private labor supply among beneficiaries. We also show that it improved local amenities in treated locations, for both beneficiary and non-beneficiaries. We then develop a spatial equilibrium model and leverage unique data on commuting flows to quantify the effect of exposure to changes in labor supply from treated locations on labor markets across the city. Our estimates imply that once fully rolled out the program increased private wages by 18.6%. Finally, we use the model to compute the welfare gains to the poor: when we include the indirect effects on private wages and local amenities the welfare gains are four times larger than the direct benefits from public employment alone.]]></description><author>Abebe, Girum &amp; Franklin, Simon &amp; Imbert, Clément &amp; Mejia-Mantilla, Carolina</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16691</guid></item><item><title>On the Persistence of the China Shock</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16688</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Autor, David & Dorn, David & Hanson, Gordon.</i> <p> <b>Monday, 01 11 2021.</b> <p> We evaluate the duration of the China trade shock and its impact on a wide range of outcomes over the period 2000 to 2019. The shock plateaued in 2010, enabling analysis of its effects for nearly a decade past its culmination. Adverse impacts of import competition on manufacturing employment, overall employment-population ratios, and income per capita in more trade-exposed U.S. commuting zones are present out to 2019. Over the full study period, greater import competition implies a reduction in the manufacturing employment-population ratio of 1.54 percentage points, which is 55% of the observed change in the value, and the absorption of 86% of this net job loss via a corresponding decrease in the overall employment rate. Reductions in population headcounts, which indicate net out-migration, register only for foreign-born workers and the native-born 25-39 years old, implying that exit from work is a primary means of adjustment to trade-induced contractions in labor demand. More negatively affected regions see modest increases in the uptake of government transfers, but these transfers primarily take the form of Social Security and Medicare benefits. Adverse outcomes are more acute in regions that initially had fewer college-educated workers and were more industrially specialized. Impacts are qualitatively-but not quantitatively-similar to those caused by the decline of employment in coal production since the 1980s, indicating that the China trade shock holds lessons for other episodes of localized job loss. Import competition from China induced changes in income per capita across local labor markets that are much larger than the spatial heterogeneity of income effects predicted by standard quantitative trade models. Even using higher-end estimates of the consumer benefits of rising trade with China, a substantial fraction of commuting zones appears to have suffered absolute declines in average real incomes.]]></description><author>Autor, David &amp; Dorn, David &amp; Hanson, Gordon</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16688</guid></item><item><title>Business Groups as Knowledge-Based Hierarchies of Firms</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16677</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Altomonte, Carlo & Ottaviano, Gianmarco & Rungi, Armando & Sonno, Tommaso.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Hierarchical differentiation is a cornerstone of the organizing process. In this paper, we do three things. First, exploiting a newly assembled dataset, we provide the first worldwide overview of the patterns of hierarchical differentiation across Business Groups (BGs), highlighting the coexistence of different hierarchical shapes. Second, we show how the different shapes can arise as optimal hierarchical structures in a knowledge-based model of BGs when subsidiaries' operations involve ubiquitous problem solving under parents' supervision. Three primitive characteristics of a BG determine its optimal choice of hierarchical structure: production efficiency and two dimensions of problem solving efficiency related to supervising knowledge creation and handling associated communication across subsidiaries.

We document striking imbalances. While Western and Northern European authors have made substantial gains, the representation of authors based in low-income countries remains extremely low -- an order of magnitude lower than the weight of their countries or regions in the global economy. Developing country representation has risen fastest at journals rated 100th or lower, while it has barely increased in journals rated 25th or higher. Fields such as international or development where global diversification may have been expected have not experienced much increase in developing country authorship. These results are consistent with a general increase in the relative supply of research in the rest of the world.

The number of people affected by solitude has been rising for some time and the Covid-19 pandemic has brought this trend to the fore. Yet, we know next to nothing about the aggregate subnational economic consequences of the rise in solitude. In this paper we analyse the consequences of solitude on regional economic performance across Europe, distinguishing between two of its key dimensions: alone living, proxied by the regional share of the population in one-person households; and loneliness, proxied by the aggregate share of social interactions. We find that solitude has important implications for economic development, but that these go in different directions. While alone living is a substantial driver of economic growth across European regions, high shares of lonely people undermine it. The connection of loneliness with economic growth is, however, dependent on the frequency of in-person meetings, with large shares of the population meeting others on a weekly basis yielding the best economic returns.]]></description><author>Burlina, Chiara &amp; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16674</guid></item><item><title>Risks and global supply chains: What we know and what we need to know</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16672</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Baldwin, Richard & Freeman, Rebecca.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Recent supply disruptions catapulted the issue of risk in global supply chains (GSCs) to the top of policy agendas and created the impression that shortages would have been less severe if GSCs were either shorter and more domestic, or more diversified. But is this right? We start our answer by reviewing studies that look at risks to and from GSCs, and how GSCs have recovered from past shocks. We then look at whether GSCs are too risky starting with business research on how firms approach the cost-resiliency trade-off. We propose the risk-versus-reward framework from portfolio theory as a good way to evaluate whether anti-risk policy is justified. We then discuss how exposures to foreign shocks are measured and argue that exposure is higher than direct indicators imply. Finally, we consider the future of GSCs in light of current policy proposals and advancing technology before pointing to the rich menu of topics for future research on the risk-GSC nexus.]]></description><author>Baldwin, Richard &amp; Freeman, Rebecca</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16672</guid></item><item><title>Telemigration and development: On the offshorability of teleworkable jobs</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16641</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Baldwin, Richard & Dingel, Jonathan.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced huge numbers of employers and employees to remote work. How many of these newly remote jobs will go overseas? We offer a rough quantification based on two observations: 1) offshore work is trade in services, and 2) the number of telemigrants is the volume of this trade divided by the average wage. Combining these with gravity-model estimates, we can roughly predict the number of new telemigrants that would arise from lower barriers to trade in services. Telemigration seems unlikely to be transformative when it comes to the development paths of most emerging economies. The baseline service trade flows are modest, and the standard gravity model restricts modest changes to have modest impacts. There are no tipping points in structural gravity models. Finally, we propose a simple model of telemigration in which small changes can have large consequences. The key is to assume that latent comparative advantage takes a different shape than typically assumed in quantitative trade models. Given this, small changes in trade costs can generate large and asymmetric increases in the exports of service tasks from low-wage nations.]]></description><author>Baldwin, Richard &amp; Dingel, Jonathan</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16641</guid></item><item><title>International trade and letters of credit: A double-edged sword in times of crises</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16630</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Crozet, Matthieu & Demir, Banu & Javorcik, Beata.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> This study argues that the ability to mitigate risks associated with international trade is particularly important at times of heightened uncertainty, such as the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Risk mitigation can be achieved through letters of credit (LCs), trade finance instruments providing guarantees to trading partners. As their use varies across products, exports of some products are more resilient than others during times of increased uncertainty. This situation reverses in times of financial crises when distressed banks may limit the supply of LCs. Our analysis using data on US and EU-15 exports during the Covid crisis and the Global Financial Crisis provides empirical support for these hypotheses.]]></description><author>Crozet, Matthieu &amp; Demir, Banu &amp; Javorcik, Beata</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16630</guid></item><item><title>Local institutions and pandemics: City autonomy and the Black Death</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16593</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés & Wang, Han.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Local institutions have long been regarded as key drivers of economic development. However, little is known about the role of institutions in preparing places to cope with public health crises and pandemics. This paper sheds light on how the nature of a local institution, city autonomy, influenced variations in the incidence of the Black Death -possibly the worst pandemic ever recorded- across cities in Western Europe between 1347 and 1352. We examine urban autonomy not only because it represented a major political shift in medieval times, but because, more importantly, it also represents a key prototype of modern political institutions. By exploiting data on the spatial variation of Black Death's mortality rates and duration using OLS and 2SLS methods, we uncover that city autonomy reduced mortality rates by, on average, almost 10 percent. Autonomous cities were in a better position to adopt swift and efficient measures against the pandemic than those governed by remote kings and emperors. This relationship has been confirmed by a series of placebo tests and robustness checks. In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that city autonomy was a factor in reducing the duration of the pandemic in European cities.]]></description><author>Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés &amp; Wang, Han</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16593</guid></item><item><title>Division of Labor and Productivity Advantage of Cities: Theory and Evidence from Brazil</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16590</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Tian, Lin.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Firms are more productive in larger cities. This paper investigates a potential explanation that was first proposed by Adam Smith: Larger cities facilitate greater division of labor within firms. Using a dataset of Brazilian firms, I first document that division of labor is indeed robustly correlated with city size, controlling for firm size. To quantify the importance of division of labor in explaining productivity advantages of cities, I propose and estimate a quantitative model that embeds a theory of firms' choice of the optimal division of labor in a spatial equilibrium framework. In the model, the observed positive correlation between firm's division of labor and city size is generated by both a selection effect -firms endogenously sort across space, choosing different extents of division of labor-and a treatment effect-larger cities increase division of labor for all firms, possibly by reducing costs associated with greater division of labor. Structural estimates derived from the model show that division of labor accounts for 17% of the productivity advantage of larger cities in Brazil, half of which is due to firm sorting and the other half to the treatment effect of larger city size. The theory also generates a set of auxiliary predictions of firms' responses to an exogenous shock to division of labor. Exploiting a quasi-experiment - the gradual roll-out of broadband internet infrastructure - I find causal empirical support for these predictions. Finally, the quasi-experiment also provides out-of-sample validation for the structural estimation: The model is successful in predicting the heterogeneous impacts of the new infrastructure across Brazilian cities.]]></description><author>Tian, Lin</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16590</guid></item><item><title>Supply Chain Resilience: Should Policy Promote Diversification or Reshoring?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16588</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Grossman, Gene M. & Helpman, Elhanan & Lhuillier, Hugo.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Supply chain disruptions, which have become commonplace, are often associated with globalization and trade. Little is known about optimal policy in the face of insecure supply chains. Should governments promote resilience by subsidizing backup sources of input supply? Should they encourage firms to source from closer and presumably safer domestic suppliers? We address these questions in a very simple model of production with a single critical input and with exogenous risks of relationship-specific and country-wide supply disturbances. We follow Matsuyama and Ushchev (2020) in positing a class of preferences that are homothetic with a single aggregator and that obey Marshall's Second Law of Demand. The familiar case of CES preferences is a member of the class, but it imposes restrictions that are important for policy conclusions.We find that, in the CES case, a subsidy for diversification achieves the constrained social optimum and dominates a policy that promotes reshoring or offshoring. When the demand elasticity rises with price, two policy instruments generally are needed to achieve efficient supply chains, private investments in resilience may be socially excessive, and policy that alter incentives to invest at home versus abroad may achieve greater welfare than ones that encourage or discourage diversification.]]></description><author>Grossman, Gene M. &amp; Helpman, Elhanan &amp; Lhuillier, Hugo</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16588</guid></item><item><title>Dynamics of Large Multinationals</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16579</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Helpman, Elhanan & Niswonger, Benjamin.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> We develop a model of large multinational enterprises, each one producing a continuum of

competitive pressure from single-product firms that engage in monopolistic competition. The
multinational enterprises invest in R&D in order to expand the span of their products and in
foreign direct investment (FDI) in order to expand the range of products manufactured by their
foreign affiliates. We study the dynamic evolution of these markets and characterize transition
dynamics and steady states. In addition to the evolution of product spans, we characterize the

We study to what extent micro-level parameters can be recovered from gravity regressions estimated with aggregate data. We show that estimation of gravity equations in their original multiplicative form via Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) is more robust to aggregation than estimation of log-linearized gravity equations via ordinary least squares (OLS). In the leading case where regressors do not vary at the micro level, PPML estimates obtained with aggregate data have a clear interpretation as trade-weighted averages of micro-level parameters that is not shared by OLS estimates. However, when regressors vary at the micro level, using disaggregated data
is essential because in this case not even PPML can recover parameters of interest.
We illustrate our results with an application to Baier and Bergstrand's (2007) influential study of the effects of trade agreements on trade flows. We examine how their findings change when estimation is performed at different levels of aggregation, and explore the consequences of aggregation for predicting the effects of trade agreements.]]></description><author>Breinlich, Holger &amp; Novy, Dennis &amp; Santos Silva, JMC</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16552</guid></item><item><title>IT and Urban Polarization</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16540</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Eeckhout, Jan & Hedtrich, Christoph & Pinheiro, Roberto.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> We show that differential IT investment across cities has been a key driver of job and wage polarization since the 1980s. Using a novel data set, we establish two stylized facts: IT investment is highest in firms in large and expensive cities, and the decline in routine cognitive occupations is most prevalent in large and expensive cities. To explain these facts, we propose a model mechanism where the substitution of routine workers by IT leads to higher IT adoption in large cities due to a higher cost of living and higher wages. We estimate the spatial equilibrium model to trace out the effects of IT on the labor market between 1990 and 2015. We find that the fall in IT prices explains 50 percent of the rising wage gap between routine and non-routine cognitive jobs. The decline in IT prices also accounts for 28 percent of the shift in employment away from routine cognitive towards non-routine cognitive jobs. Moreover, our estimates show that the impact of IT is uneven across space. Expensive locations have seen a stronger displacement of routine cognitive jobs and a larger widening of the wage gap between routine and non-routine cognitive jobs.]]></description><author>Eeckhout, Jan &amp; Hedtrich, Christoph &amp; Pinheiro, Roberto</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16540</guid></item><item><title>The Long-Term Effects of Industrial Policy</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16534</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Choi, Jaedo & Levchenko, Andrei A..</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> This paper provides causal evidence of the impact of industrial policy on firms' long-term performance and quantifies industrial policy's long-term welfare effects. Using a natural experiment and unique historical data during the Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) Drive in South Korea, we find large and persistent effects of firm-level subsidies on firm size. Subsidized firms are larger than those never subsidized even 30 years after subsidies ended. Motivated by this empirical finding, we build a quantitative heterogeneous firm model that rationalizes these persistent effects through a combination of learning-by-doing (LBD) and financial frictions that hinder firms from internalizing LBD. The model is calibrated to firm-level micro data, and its key parameters are disciplined with the econometric estimates. Cost-benefit analysis implies that the industrial policy generated larger benefits than costs. If the industrial policy had not been implemented, South Korea's welfare would have been 22-31% lower, depending on how long-lived are the productivity benefits of LBD. Between one-half and two-thirds of the total welfare difference comes from the long-term effects of the policy.]]></description><author>Choi, Jaedo &amp; Levchenko, Andrei A.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16534</guid></item><item><title>Spending a Windfall</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16523</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Palma, Nuno Pedro G. & Silva, André.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> We study the effect of the discovery of precious metals in America on international trade from 1500 to 1810.

governments' leaning and enacted policies. Using newly assembled data for 23 advanced
democracies, we document a protectionist and isolationist shift in electorates, legislatures,

shift in trade policy â??although with some notable nuancesâ?? especially since the financial
crisis of 2008. We discuss the economics of the backlash. From a theoretical perspective,
we highlight how the backlash may arise within standard trade models when taking into account
the 'social footprint' of globalization. Then, we review the empirical literature on the
drivers of the backlash. Two main messages emerge from our analysis: (1) globalization is a
significant driver of the backlash, by means of the distributional consequences entailed by
rising trade exposure; yet (2) the backlash is only partly determined by trade. Technological
change, crisis-driven fiscal austerity, immigration, and cultural concerns are found to play
an important role in creating politically consequential cleavages. Looking ahead, we discuss

We overview productivity concepts, facts, data, measurement, analysis, and open questions.]]></description><author>De Loecker, Jan &amp; Syverson, Chad</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16513</guid></item><item><title>Road Capacity, Domestic Trade and Regional Outcomes</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16512</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Cosar, Kerem & Demir, Banu & Ghose, Devaki & Young, Nathaniel.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> What is the impact on intra-national trade and regional economic outcomes when the quality and lane-capacity of an existing paved road network is expanded significantly? We investigate this question for the case of Turkey, which undertook a large-scale public investment in roads during the 2000s. Using spatially disaggregated data on road upgrades and domestic transactions, we estimate a large positive impact of reduced travel times on trade as well as local manufacturing employment and wages. A quantitative exercise using a workhorse model of spatial equilibrium implies heterogeneous effects across locations, with aggregate real income gains reaching 2-3 percent in the long-run. Reductions in travel times increased local employment-to-population ratio but had no effect on local population. We extend the model by endogenizing the labor supply decision to capture this finding. The model-implied elasticity of employment rates to travel time reductions captures about one-third of the empirical elasticity.]]></description><author>Cosar, Kerem &amp; Demir, Banu &amp; Ghose, Devaki &amp; Young, Nathaniel</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16512</guid></item></channel></rss>
