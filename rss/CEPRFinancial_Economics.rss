We develop a benchmark theoretical setting that integrates core corporate finance insights about the impact of financial frictions on investment with those from industrial organization on dynamic competition and industry evolution under perfect capital markets. Using state of the art computational tools to systematically detect and evaluate multiple equilibria and to thoroughly explore the parameter space of our model, we show how, depending on key industry characteristics such as market size, financial frictions impact firms' pricing and investment strategies and the degree of industry concentration.]]></description><author>Doraszelski, Ulrich &amp; Gomes, Joao F &amp; Nockher, Felix</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16567</guid></item><item><title>Credit Market Competition and Bank Capitalization</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16566</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We document that within regional U.S. mortgage markets an increase in competition exerts differential effects on banks with large and small market shares.

It stems largely from better ability to contract and easier access to justice. Yet in close association, common law also offers lawyers potentially more room for rent-Â¬seeking than civil law. Thereby the costs could outweigh the benefits. Both real GDP per capita and openness emerge as further factors making room for lawyers.]]></description><author>Dia, Enzo &amp; Melitz, Jacques</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16565</guid></item><item><title>Strategic Leadership in Corporate Social Responsibility</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16564</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We propose a strategic theory of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Shareholder maximizers commit to a mission statement that extends beyond firm value maximiza- tion. This commitment leads firms (either product market competitors or complementors along the value chain) to change their actions in ways that ultimately favor shareholders. We thus provide a formal analysis of the "doing well by doing good" adage. We also pro- vide conditions such that the mission statement game has the nature of a pure coordination game. Our framework thus provides a natural theory of firm leadership in a CSR context: by selecting a CSR mission statement, a first mover effectively leads the industry to a Pareto optimal equilibrium.]]></description><author>Albuquerque, Rui &amp; Cabral, Luís M B</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16564</guid></item><item><title>Monetary Policy, Labor Income Redistribution and the Credit Channel: Evidence from Matched Employer-Employee and Credit Registers</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16549</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> This paper documents the redistributive effects of monetary policy on labor market outcomes via
the credit channel. For identification, we exploit matched administrative datasets in Portugal
- employee-employer and credit registers - and monetary policy since the Eurozone creation
in 1999. We find that softer monetary policy improves worker labor market outcomes (wages,
hours worked and firm employment) more in small and young firms, which are more financially
constrained. Within small and young firms, the wage effects accrue to incumbent workers,
in line with the back-loaded wage mechanism. Consistent with the capital-skill complementarity
mechanism, we document an increase in skill premium and show that financially constrained
firms increase both physical and human capital investment by most. Our findings uncover
a central role for both the firm-balance sheet and the bank lending channels of the monetary
policy transmission to labor income inequality, with state-dependent effects that are substantially
stronger during crisis times. Importantly, we do not find any redistributive effects for firms
without bank credit.]]></description><author>Jasova, Martina &amp; Mendicino, Caterina &amp; Panetti, Ettore &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Supera, Dominik</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16549</guid></item><item><title>Dealer Funding and Market Liquidity</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16548</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We consider a model in which dealers intermediate trades between clients and provide immediacy, or, market liquidity. Dealers can exert unobservable search effort to improve the chance of intermediating profitably.  This moral-hazard friction impairs dealers' ability to raise external finance and hence to compete aggressively with each other in providing liquidity. Market liquidity is limited even for safe assets and more so for assets with higher search cost. To alleviate the financing friction, dealers opt to finance with debt and intermediate in several markets simultaneously. Dealer leverage is therefore endogenous and related to variations in liquidity across otherwise unrelated markets. Our results shed light on how post-crisis regulations influence the provision of immediacy in bond markets.]]></description><author>Bruche, Max &amp; Kuong, John Chi-Fong</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16548</guid></item><item><title>When Green Meets Green</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16536</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We investigate whether and how the environmental consciousness (greenness for short) of firms and banks is reflected in the pricing of bank credit. Using a large international sample of syndicated loans over the period 2011-2019, we find that firms are indeed rewarded for being
green in the form of cheaper loans -- however, only when borrowing from a green consortium of lenders, and only after the ratification of the Paris Agreement in 2015. Thus, we find that environmental attitudes matter "when green meets green." We further construct a simple
stylized theoretical model to show that the green-meets-green pattern emerges in equilibrium as the result of third-degree price discrimination with regard to firms' greenness.]]></description><author>Degryse, Hans &amp; Goncharenko, Roman &amp; Theunisz, Carola &amp; Vadasz, Tamas</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16536</guid></item><item><title>Does Political Partisanship Cross Borders?

We provide evidence from two settings, syndicated corporate loans and equity mutual funds, to show that ideological alignment with foreign governments affects the cross-border capital allocation by U.S. institutional investors. Moreover, we find that ideological alignment with foreign countries also affects investments of non-U.S. investors and can explain patterns in bilateral FDI flows. Our empirical strategy ensures that direct economic effects of foreign elections or bilateral ties between countries are not driving the result. Combined, our findings imply that partisan perception is a global phenomenon and its economic effects transcend national borders.]]></description><author>Kempf, Elisabeth &amp; Luo, Mancy &amp; Schaefer, Larissa &amp; Tsoutsoura, Margarita</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16533</guid></item><item><title>Regulating Insurance Markets: Multiple Contracting and Adverse Selection</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16531</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> This paper studies an insurance market on which privately informed consumers can simultaneously trade with several firms operating under a regulation that prohibits cross-subsidies between contracts. The regulated game supports a single equilibrium allocation in which each layer of coverage is fairly priced given the consumer types who purchase it. This competitive allocation cannot be Pareto-improved by a social planner who observes neither consumers' types nor their trades with firms. Public intervention under multiple contracting and adverse selection should thus arguably target firms' pricing strategies, leaving consumers free to choose their preferred amount of coverage.]]></description><author>Attar, Andrea &amp; Mariotti, Thomas &amp; Salanié, François</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16531</guid></item><item><title>On the Instability of Private Intertemporal Liquidity Provision</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16528</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We establish that the provision of intertemporal liquidity is fundamentally prone to instability.

We identify a mechanism that alleviates crowding -- trading diversification: institutions exploiting different characteristics can reduce each other's price-impact costs even when their rebalancing trades are not negatively correlated. Empirically, trading diversification increases capacity by 45%, optimal investment by 43%, and profits by 22%. Using a game-theoretic model, we show that, while competition to exploit a characteristic erodes its profits because of crowding, competition among institutions exploiting other characteristics alleviates crowding. Using mutual-fund holdings, we provide empirical support for the model's predictions.]]></description><author>DeMiguel, Victor &amp; Martin-Utrera, Alberto &amp; Uppal, Raman</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16527</guid></item><item><title>Measuring Market Expectations</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16520</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Asset prices are a valuable source of information about financial market participants' expectations about key macroeconomic variables. However, the presence of time-varying risk premia requires an adjustment of market prices to obtain the market's rational assessment of future price and policy developments. This paper reviews empirical approaches for recovering market-based expectations. It starts by laying out the two canonical modeling frameworks that form the backbone for estimating risk premia and highlights the proliferation of risk pricing factors that result in a wide range of different asset-price-based expectation measures. It then describes a key methodological innovation to evaluate the empirical plausibility of risk premium estimates and to identify the most accurate market-based expectation measure. The usefulness of this general approach is illustrated for price expectations in the global oil market. Then, the paper provides an overview of the body of empirical evidence for monetary policy and inflation expectations with a special emphasis on market-specific characteristics that complicate the quest for the best possible market-based expectation measure. Finally, it discusses a number of economic applications where market expectations play a key role for evaluating economic models, guiding policy analysis, and deriving shock measures.]]></description><author>Baumeister, Christiane</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16520</guid></item><item><title>Distrust or speculation?

Compared with the general population, investors show no differences in their level of security concerns with either cash or commercial banking services. We find that cryptocurrency investors tend to be educated, young and digital natives. In recent years, a gap in ownership of cryptocurrencies across genders has emerged.

For identification, we exploit the introduction of a Mexican law limiting the debt of subnational
governments along with matched credit register, firm, bank, and state datasets. After the law,
states with higher ex ante public debt grow substantially faster, despite larger fiscal consolidation
(higher taxes and lower public expenditure). Banks operating in more indebted states reallocate
credit supply away from local governments into private firms, with stronger effects for banks with
higher exposure to local public debt, consistent with lowering crowding out. Effects only happen
after the law, not before, and there are strong firm-level real effects associated. The reduction of
crowding out is stronger for financially constrained firms and for firms operating in states with
higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure projects. In states more
affected by the law, despite better economic effects, extreme poverty increases--especially in
states with higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure--consistent with
a strong reduction for social services during the fiscal consolidation.]]></description><author>Morais, Bernardo &amp; Perez-Estrada, Javier &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Ruiz-Ortega, Claudia</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16511</guid></item><item><title>Capital Controls, Domestic Macroprudential Policy and the Bank Lending Channel of Monetary Policy</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16510</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We study how capital controls and domestic macroprudential policy tame credit supply booms, respectively targeting foreign and domestic bank debt. For identification, we exploit the simultaneous introduction of capital controls on foreign exchange (FX) debt inflows and an increase of reserve requirements on domestic bank deposits in Colombia during a strong credit boom, as well as credit registry and bank balance sheet data. Our results suggest that first, an increase in the local monetary policy rate, raising the interest rate spread with the United States, allows more FX-indebted banks to carry trade cheap FX funds with more expensive peso lending, especially toward riskier, opaque firms. Capital controls tax FX debt and break the carry trade. Second, the increase in reserve requirements on domestic deposits directly reduces credit supply, and more so for riskier, opaque firms, rather than enhances the transmission of monetary rates on credit supply. Importantly, different banks finance credit in the boom with either domestic or foreign (FX) financing. Hence, capital controls and domestic macroprudential policy complementarily mitigate the boom and the associated risk-taking through two distinct channels.]]></description><author>Fabiani, Andrea &amp; Lopéz Piñeros, Martha &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Soto, Paul</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16510</guid></item><item><title>The Financial Channel of Wage Rigidity</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16499</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> I propose a financial channel of wage rigidity. In recessions, rather than propping up marginal (new hires') costs of labor, rigid average wages squeeze cash flows, forcing firms to cut hiring due to financial constraints. Indeed, empirical cash flows and profits would turn acyclical if wages were only moderately more procyclical. I study this channel in a search and matching model with financial constraints and rigid wages among incumbent workers, while new hires' wages are flexible. Individually, each feature generates no amplification. By contrast, their interaction can account for much of the empirical labor market fluctuations--breaking the neutrality of incumbents' wages for hiring, and showing that financial amplification of business cycles requires wage rigidity.]]></description><author>Schoefer, Benjamin</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16499</guid></item><item><title>Persuasion in Global Games with Application to Stress Testing</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16484</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We study robust/adversarial information design in global games, with an application to stress testing. We show that the optimal policy coordinates all market participants on the same course of action. Importantly, while it removes any "strategic uncertainty," it preserves heterogeneity in "structural uncertainty" (that is, in beliefs over payoff fundamentals). We identify conditions under which the optimal policy is a "pass/fail" test, show that the optimal test need not be monotone in fundamentals, but also identify conditions under which it is monotone. Finally, we show how the effects of an increase in market uncertainty on the toughness of the optimal stress test depend on the securities issued by the banks.]]></description><author>Inostroza, Nicolas &amp; Pavan, Alessandro</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16484</guid></item><item><title>Mutual Fund Loyalty and ESG Stock Resilience During the COVID-19 Stock Market Crash</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16477</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper studies the trading behavior of U.S. actively-managed equity mutual funds during the COVID-19 market crash. We show that Environmental, Social, and Gover- nance (ESG) funds helped to stabilize the market by contributing to the resiliency of ESG stocks, but interestingly non-ESG funds also provided support for ESG stocks. First, ESG funds reduced net sales during the crash, controlling for fund flows. Sec- ond, all funds experiencing inflows helped to stabilize the market during the crash by increasing net purchases, but the behaviour was more pronounced for ESG funds. Third, funds experiencing outflows also played a key role contributing to the relative stability of ESG stocks as both ESG and non-ESG funds sold more aggressively their non-ESG stocks. We are able to uncover these results because we use monthly holdings data from Morningstar, instead of the commonly used quarterly data.]]></description><author>Albuquerque, Rui &amp; Koskinen, Yrjo &amp; Santioni, Raffaele</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16477</guid></item><item><title>Filing Speed, Information Leakage, and Price Formation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16476</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This study investigates the price discovery process in equity markets with informed institutional investors.

We also find that the longer the leakage period for institutional investors to exploit, the less informative is the news when it becomes public.

This paper explores how expectations of selective default affect sovereign bond trading and sovereign risk premia based on a historical laboratory: the German external default of the 1930s. We exploit a unique feature of the interwar sovereign bond market: identical German government bonds were traded on different creditor countries' secondary debt markets but investors expected creditors from various countries to be treated differently in case of default. We show that, when creditor countries' secondary debt markets are integrated, selective default expectations are not reflected in bond yields but affect the volume of bonds traded across markets. By contrast, when creditors' debt markets are geographically segmented, a large selective risk premium can be priced in sovereign bonds. This premium accounted for up to half of the total risk premium on German external bonds during the 1930s. We establish that creditor countries' seniority ranks can be explained by their economic power over the debtor government.]]></description><author>Accominotti, Olivier &amp; Albers, Thilo &amp; Oosterlinck, Kim</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16474</guid></item><item><title>Ripple effects of monetary policy</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16465</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Is conventional monetary policy transmitted through the demand for and supply of intermediate goods in an economy? Analyzing unique US data on corporate linkages, we document that downstream and upstream corporate financial health are instrumental for the transmission of monetary policy. Our estimates suggest that contractionary changes in monetary conditions lead to reductions in both the demand and the supply of all financially constrained business partners, thereby creating bottlenecks, which induce the linked firms themselves to curtail their own activities ("ripple effects''). Overall, our estimates suggest that changes in monetary conditions may have a quantitatively larger impact on firms' operations through the changes in demand and supply induced by constrained business partners than through the firms' own financial conditions.]]></description><author>Boissay, Frederic &amp; Garcia-Appendini, Emilia &amp; Ongena, Steven</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16465</guid></item><item><title>Counterparty Choice, Bank Interconnectedness, and Systemic Risk</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16458</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We provide evidence on how banks form network connections and endogenous risk-taking in their non-bank counterparty choices in the OTC derivative markets. We use confidential regulatory data from the Capital Assessment and Stress Testing reports that provide counterparty-level data across a wide range of OTC markets for the most systemically important U.S. banks. We show that banks are more likely to either establish or maintain a relationship, and increase their exposures within an existing relationship, with non-bank counterparties that are already heavily connected and exposed to other banks. Banks in such densely-connected networks are more likely to connect with riskier counterparties for their most material exposures. The effects are strongest in the case of (non-bank) financial counterparties. These findings suggest moral hazard behavior in counterparty choices. Finally, we demonstrate that these exposures are strongly linked to systemic risk. Overall, the results suggest a network formation process that amplifies risk propagation through non-bank linkages in opaque financial markets.]]></description><author>Ellul, Andrew &amp; Kim, Dasol</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16458</guid></item><item><title>Mortgage Pricing and Monetary Policy</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16456</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper provides novel evidence on lenders' mortgage pricing and how central bank policies affected it. Using the universe of mortgages originated in the U.K., we show that lenders seek to segment the market by offering two-part tariffs composed of interest rates and origination fees, and that during recent periods of unconventional monetary policy, such as the U.K.'s Funding for Lending Scheme, lenders decreased interest rates and increased  origination fees. To understand lenders' pricing strategies and their effects on market equilibrium, we develop and estimate a structural discrete-continuous model of mortgage demand and lender competition in which borrowers may have different sensitivities to rates and fees. We use the estimated model to decompose the effects of unconventional monetary policies on mortgage pricing and lending, and find that central bank policies increased borrower surplus and lender profits. Moreover, although origination fees allow lenders to price discriminate and capture surplus, banning fees would lower borrower surplus and aggregate welfare.]]></description><author>Benetton, Matteo &amp; Gavazza, Alessandro &amp; Surico, Paolo</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16456</guid></item><item><title>Ownership Concentration and Performance of Deteriorating Syndicated Loans</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16452</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Regulation and capital constraints may force banks and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) to sell deteriorating loans, potentially hampering renegotiation and amplifying the initial negative shock to the borrower.

However, syndicates remain less concentrated when potential buyers experience financial constraints and subsequently loans are less likely to be amended and more likely to be downgraded even further. Our findings indicate that existing regulations may amplify shocks to credit quality during periods of generalized distress in the financial system.]]></description><author>Giannetti, Mariassunta &amp; Meisenzahl, Ralf</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16452</guid></item><item><title>Financial crises: A survey</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16450</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Financial crises have large deleterious effects on economic activity, and as such have been the focus of a large body of research. This study surveys the existing literature on financial crises, exploring how crises are measured, whether they are predictable, and why they are associated with economic contractions. Historical narrative techniques continue to form the backbone for measuring crises, but there have been exciting developments in using quantitative data as well. Crises are predictable with growth in credit and elevated asset prices playing an especially important role; recent research points convincingly to the importance of behavioral biases in explaining such predictability. The negative consequences of a crisis are due to both the crisis itself but also to the imbalances that precede a crisis. Crises do not occur randomly, and, as a result, an understanding of financial crises requires an investigation into the booms that precede them.]]></description><author>Sufi, Amir &amp; Taylor, Alan M.</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16450</guid></item><item><title>Corrective Regulation with Imperfect Instruments</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16448</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper studies the optimal design of second-best corrective regulation, when some agents or activities cannot be perfectly regulated.

Moreover, demand curves are steeper than with homogeneous beliefs.

In the general equilibrium model, banks have to hold liquid assets, and choose among illiquid assets varying in the extent to which they are difficult to value before maturity, e.g., structured securities. By improving the liquidity of interbank markets, tighter liquidity requirements induce banks to invest in such complex assets. We evaluate the welfare properties of combining liquidity regulation with other financial-stability policies, and show that it can complement ex-ante policies, such as asset-specific taxes, whereas it can undermine the benefits of ex-post interventions, such as quantitative easing.]]></description><author>Bosshardt, Joshua &amp; Kakhbod, Ali &amp; Saidi, Farzad</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16438</guid></item><item><title>Do we need dealers in OTC markets?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16437</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We examine technology enabling dispersed investors to directly trade with each other in over- the-counter markets via the largest electronic trading platform in corporate bonds starting Open Trading (OT) to allow investor-to-investor trading. Over our six year sample OT steadily grew to win 12% of trades on the platform, with 2% being investor-to-investor trading, 3% being dealers trading with new clients, and 7% being new liquidity providers acting like dealers. This suggests that investors in corporate bonds prefer intermediation to direct trade. However, OT can enable new dealers to compete in liquidity provision. OT's steady growth facilitates measuring its effect on investors, dealers, and competition to provide liquidity using an auction model.]]></description><author>Hendershott, Terrence &amp; Livdan, Dmitry &amp; Schürhoff, Norman</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16437</guid></item><item><title>When Is (Performance-Sensitive) Debt Optimal?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16433</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Existing theories of debt consider a single contractible performance measure ("output"). In reality, many other performance signals are also available. It may seem that debt is no longer optimal; for example, if the signals are sufficiently positive, the agent should receive a payment even if output is low. This paper shows that debt remains the optimal contract under additional signals -- they only affect the face value of debt, but not the form of the contract. We show how the face value should depend on other signals, providing a theory of performance-sensitive debt.]]></description><author>Edmans, Alex</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16433</guid></item><item><title>Can Monetary Policy Create Fiscal Capacity?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16414</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> Governments around the world have gone on a massive fiscal expansion in response to the Covid crisis, increasing government debt to levels not seen in 75 years. How will this debt be repaid?  What role do conventional and unconventional monetary policy play? We  investigate debt sustainability in a New Keynesian model with an intermediary sector, realistic fiscal and monetary policy, endogenous convenience yields, and substantial risk premia. When conventional monetary policy is constrained by the ZLB during an economic crisis, increased government spending and lower tax revenue lead to a large rise in government debt and raise the risk of future tax increases. We find that quantitative easing (QE), forward guidance, and an expansion in government discretionary spending all contribute to lowering debt/GDP ratio and reducing this fiscal risk. A transitory QE policy deployed during a crisis stimulates aggregate demand.]]></description><author>Elenev, Vadim &amp; Landvoigt, Tim &amp; Shultz, Patrick &amp; van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16414</guid></item><item><title>The Risks of Safe Assets</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16407</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> How much safety and liquidity can the US government provide? Should it accommodate demand for these attributes because high convenience yields in Treasuries lower its borrowing cost? We evaluate a novel fiscal risk channel limiting the government's capacity to issue debt through the lens of a general equilibrium asset pricing model with a rich fiscal sector. Expanding safe asset supply lowers safety premia and improves liquidity in financial markets, but creates  tax and consumption volatility, raising risk premia, credit spreads, and firms' cost of capital. Our  model predicts that this risk channel leads to depressed growth prospects, rising Treasury yields, and elevated consumption risk, for which we find strong empirical evidence. We use our model to quantitatively evaluate current proposals on stimulus and stabilization packages and find that the risk channel is exacerbated in times of fiscal stress. Increasing safe asset supply can thus be risky, and have a significant fiscal cost.]]></description><author>Liu, Yang &amp; Schmid, Lukas &amp; Yaron, Amir</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16407</guid></item><item><title>Financial 'Side Effects' of QE and Conventional Monetary Policy Compared</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16395</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We explore the size of financial 'side effects' of QE relative to those of conventional monetary policy for the Euro Area, UK and US. Following previous work for conventional monetary policy we examine the effects on private credit imbalances, financial market risk and asset valuation. We adopt an agnostic Bayesian VAR approach, identifying QE and conventional monetary policy shocks with four different identification schemes and two different measures of unconventional monetary policy. We compare the size of each side effect by the amount of inflation generated by each policy, as all three of these central banks were targeting inflation during this time. The relative size of these effects is at the heart of the current debate about the financial stability and wealth inequality consequences of accommodative monetary policy. While both, conventional monetary policy and QE, generate some financial 'side effects', there is no statistical evidence that the effect of QE on these variables is consistently larger than the effect of conventional monetary policy.]]></description><author>Weale, M &amp; Wieladek, Tomasz</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16395</guid></item><item><title>Pricing Ethics in the Foreign Exchange Market: Environmental, Social and Governance Ratings and Currency Premia</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16392</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We examine the cross-sectional predictive ability of the Refinitiv Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) score for returns in the foreign exchange market, using ESG scores aggregated at the national level, and find that ESG is a strong negative predictor of currency returns. Intuitively, investors require a premium for financing low-ESG countries while high-ESG countries offer lower returns and provide a hedge in the bad state of the world. We show that ESG is priced in the cross-section of currency returns. We also consider the different components of ESG and show that its predictability is driven by the environmental pillar of the ESG ratings. The profitability of the ESG currency strategy is not driven by the carry trade and is robust to transaction costs.]]></description><author>Filippou, Ilias &amp; Taylor, Mark</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16392</guid></item><item><title>The Correlation Risk Premium: International Evidence</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16389</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> In this paper we carry out the first cross-country analysis of the correlation risk premium.

We find evidence of strong co-movement of correlation risk premiums in European and US equity markets.
Our results support the existence of a strong empirical relationship between the global correlation risk premium and international equity market option returns. We document the dependence of the correlation risk premium on macroeconomic policy uncertainty and related

Using confidential Census plant-level data, we show that large manufacturing plant openings not only raise the productivity of local plants but also of distant plants hundreds of miles away, which belong to multi-region firms that are exposed to the local productivity spillover through one of their plants. To quantify the significance of plant-level networks for the propagation and amplification of local productivity shocks, we develop and estimate a quantitative spatial model in which plants of multi-region firms are linked through shared knowledge. Our model features heterogeneous regions, which interact through goods trade and labor markets, as well as within-location, across-plant heterogeneity in productivity, wages, and employment. Counterfactual exercises show that while knowledge sharing through plant-level networks amplifies the aggregate effects of local productivity shocks, it widens economic disparities between individual workers and regions in the economy.]]></description><author>Giroud, Xavier &amp; Lenzu, Simone &amp; Maingi, Quinn &amp; Mueller, Holger M</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16388</guid></item><item><title>The real explanation of nominal bond-stock puzzles</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16381</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We present evidence that the mix of transitory and permanent shocks to consumption is changing over time. We study implications of this finding for asset prices. The uncovered dynamics of consumption implies modestly upward sloping real bond and equity curves, upward sloping nominal yield curve, and sign-switching correlation between equities and bonds consistent with the stylized facts. This is achieved without relying on the nominal channel too much. That is, as in the data, the variation of inflation in the model is under 40% as a fraction of variation in nominal yields.]]></description><author>Chernov, Mikhail &amp; Lochstoer, Lars &amp; Song, Dongo</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16381</guid></item><item><title>Who Owns What?

We find that stock characteristics such as firm age and share price have strong investor clienteles associated with them. Similarly, account attributes such as account age, account size, and extreme underdiversification (holding a single stock) are associated with particular characteristic preferences. Coheld stocks tend to have higher return covariance, suggestive of the importance of clientele effects in the stock market.]]></description><author>Balasubramaniam, Vimal &amp; Campbell, John Y &amp; Ramadorai, Tarun &amp; Ranish, Benjamin</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16378</guid></item><item><title>Bayesian Learning</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16377</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We survey work using Bayesian learning in macroeconomics, highlighting common themes and new directions.

When we apply robust regression methods, we confirm both studies' inferences about scale diseconomies at the fund and industry levels. Moreover, data errors play no role, as both studies' results are insensitive to applying various error screens and using alternative return benchmarks. We reject constant returns to scale even after dropping 25% of the most extreme return observations.

The blueprint for the postwar international economy agreed at Bretton Woods in 1944 envisioned nothing like today's extensive and fluid global capital market. The demise of the 1946-1973 fixed exchange rate system, however, also brought a progressive dismantling of barriers to international financial flows motivated by special-interest politics, national economic competition, and ideology â?? alongside the benign desire for a more efficient international allocation of capital. Unfortunately, free cross-border financial capital mobility can compromise governments' capacities to attain domestic economic and social goals in several ways. This essay links the dynamics of financial liberalization to the Teflon-like resilience of finance to backlash so far, and suggests that stronger backlash could emerge if national governments fail to enhance multilateral cooperation to manage the financial commons.]]></description><author>Obstfeld, Maurice</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16375</guid></item></channel></rss>
