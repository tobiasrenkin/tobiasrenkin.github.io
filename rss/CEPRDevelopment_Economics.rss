Lessons from Egypt Reducing Years of Compulsory Schooling</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16568</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Exploiting a unique policy reform in Egypt that reduced the number of years of compulsory schooling, we show that it unexpectedly increased education attainment. This impact is almost entirely driven by girls from more disadvantaged households staying in school longer. Treated women later experienced important positive improvements in labor market opportunity and marriage quality, as measured by bride price received and household bargaining power. We reject changes in school quality as a driving mechanism and attribute the increased investment in girl's human capitcal to adjustments by credit-constrained families when school costs dropped combined with strongly non-linear returns to female education.]]></description><author>Elsayed, Ahmed &amp; Marie, Olivier</author></item><item><title>Altruism and the Topology of Transfer Networks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16561</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We examine whether the pattern of transfers among villagers can be explained either by a model of pure altruism or by a model of dynamic incentives, by comparing the predictions of these models to actual transfer patterns in Gambian villages. We find that the topology of transfer networks violate some of the predictions of both models. We then generalize the model of pure altruism to include caps on transfers that represent transaction costs, liquidity constraints, and social norms. Even with a parsimonious parametrization, the generalized model predicts equilibrium networks with topological features that match closely those of intra-village transfer networks in rural Gambia. Using a simulation-based indirect inference approach, we estimate the structural parameters of this model, relying only on income data and the topology of the transfer network for identification. We test for the existence of binding caps on transfers and find that network topologies are consistent
with strong caps on transfers. Our structural estimates confirm that kinship is a strong predictor of altruistic preferences. We corroborate our structural estimates using proxies for transaction costs from surveys.]]></description><author>Fafchamps, Marcel &amp; Heß, Simon</author></item><item><title>Entrepreneurial Motive, Ambiguity Attitudes and Willingness to Compete</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16559</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Different entrepreneurial motivations can lead to different business outcomes. The origins of these difference in outcomes are not well understood so far. In this study, we use a lab-in-the-field experiment to analyze how two distinct types of entrepreneurs handle the uncertainty of competition. Our subject pool includes people with real entrepreneurial experience, who either started a business out of necessity or who took an optional business opportunity. We test a treatment that boosts feelings of competence and whether ambiguity aversion or a-insensitivity moderate the treatment effect on willingness to compete. Our results indicate that necessity entrepreneurs are more likely to adjust their decision-making following the treatment. A-insensitivity, as opposed to ambiguity aversion, plays an important role in differentiating their responses from that of opportunity entrepreneurs.]]></description><author>Brock, Michelle &amp; Koch, Melanie</author></item><item><title>Screening and Signaling Non-Cognitive Skills: Experimental Evidence from Uganda</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16546</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We study how employers and job-seekers respond to credible information on skills that are difficult to observe, and how this affects matching in the labor market. We experimentally vary whether certificates on workers' non-cognitive skills are disclosed to both sides of the market during job interviews between young workers and small firms in Uganda. The certificates cause workers to increase their labor market expectations, while high-ability managers revise their assessments of the workers' skills upwards. The reaction in terms of beliefs leads to an increase in positive assortative matching and to higher earnings for workers, conditional on employment.]]></description><author>Bassi, Vittorio &amp; Nansamba, Aisha</author></item><item><title>Road Capacity, Domestic Trade and Regional Outcomes</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16512</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> What is the impact on intra-national trade and regional economic outcomes when the quality and lane-capacity of an existing paved road network is expanded significantly? We investigate this question for the case of Turkey, which undertook a large-scale public investment in roads during the 2000s. Using spatially disaggregated data on road upgrades and domestic transactions, we estimate a large positive impact of reduced travel times on trade as well as local manufacturing employment and wages. A quantitative exercise using a workhorse model of spatial equilibrium implies heterogeneous effects across locations, with aggregate real income gains reaching 2-3 percent in the long-run. Reductions in travel times increased local employment-to-population ratio but had no effect on local population. We extend the model by endogenizing the labor supply decision to capture this finding. The model-implied elasticity of employment rates to travel time reductions captures about one-third of the empirical elasticity.]]></description><author>Cosar, Kerem &amp; Demir, Banu &amp; Ghose, Devaki &amp; Young, Nathaniel</author></item><item><title>Expansionary Austerity: Reallocating Credit Amid Fiscal Consolidation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16511</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We show expansionary fiscal austerity via reallocation of credit supply, but with a raise in poverty.
For identification, we exploit the introduction of a Mexican law limiting the debt of subnational
governments along with matched credit register, firm, bank, and state datasets. After the law,
states with higher ex ante public debt grow substantially faster, despite larger fiscal consolidation
(higher taxes and lower public expenditure). Banks operating in more indebted states reallocate
credit supply away from local governments into private firms, with stronger effects for banks with
higher exposure to local public debt, consistent with lowering crowding out. Effects only happen
after the law, not before, and there are strong firm-level real effects associated. The reduction of
crowding out is stronger for financially constrained firms and for firms operating in states with
higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure projects. In states more
affected by the law, despite better economic effects, extreme poverty increases--especially in
states with higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure--consistent with
a strong reduction for social services during the fiscal consolidation.]]></description><author>Morais, Bernardo &amp; Perez-Estrada, Javier &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Ruiz-Ortega, Claudia</author></item><item><title>Understanding Chile's Social Unrest in an International Perspective</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16494</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Abstract
We aim to provide a broad descriptive overview of Chile's social issues, in comparison to other countries and over time, in order to place the recent social unrest in historical and international perspectives which can help prepare the ground for future policy priorities. We follow an eclectic approach, classifying a broad set of indicators along six dimensions-inequality across: i) income; ii) perception; iii) access; iv) opportunity; v) redistribution; and vi) location. The analysis puts forward a set of descriptive findings. First, income inequality declined substantially but remains high, also compared to countries with similar level and path of development. Second, Chile seems to be one of the few countries in Latin America with declining inequality where perceived inequality actually increased. Third, notwithstanding an increase in social spending, access to essential services appears limited, particularly for middle and lower income classes, amid fast growth of out-of-pocket health expenses, relatively faster growth of cost of living for the relatively poorer, and remaining weaknesses in the pension and education systems. Fourth, inequality of opportunity is high, with limited competition. Fifth, fiscal redistribution has improved markedly, but remains low by international standards. Finally, inter-regional inequality has declined substantially over the last two decades, reaching levels similar to the OECD median.]]></description><author>Hadzi-Vaskov, Metodij &amp; Ricci, Luca Antonio</author></item><item><title>Countering misinformation with targeted messages: Experimental evidence using mobile phones</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16492</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Widespread misconceptions can be critical, especially in times of crisis. Through a field experiment, we study how to address such wrong or inaccurate beliefs using messages delivered to individual citizens using mobile phones. We focus on misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic in a hard-to-reach population â?? India's slum residents. We randomly allocate participants to receive voice and video messages introduced by a local citizen, the messenger, and in which medical practitioners debunk misconceptions. To understand the role of targeting, we randomly vary the signaled religious identity of the messenger into either Muslim or Hindu, guaranteeing exogenous variation in religion concordance between messenger and recipient. Doctor messages are effective at increasing knowledge of, and compliance with, COVID-19 policy guidelines. Changes in misconceptions are observed only when there is religion concordance and mainly for religious-salient misconceptions. Correcting misconceptions with information requires targeting messages to specific populations and tailoring them to individual characteristics.]]></description><author>Armand, Alex &amp; Augsburg, Britta &amp; Bancalari, Antonella &amp; Kameshwara, Kalyan Kumar</author></item><item><title>Big Fish in Thin Markets: Competing with the Middlemen to Increase Market Access in the Amazon</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16487</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Middlemen are ubiquitous in supply chains. In developing countries they help bring products from remote communities to end markets but may exert strong market power. We study a cooperative intervention which organizes together poor fishing communities in the Amazon --- one of the poorest and most remote regions of the world --- to purchase large boats in order to partially bypass middlemen and deliver their fish directly to market. We find that the intervention increases income by 27%, largely through an increase in price received, and also increases consumption. Moreover, the intervention is highly cost effective with the projected stream of income gains easily covering the cost of the investment. Finally, we formalize a model in which the market power of middlemen itself can create a poverty trap, which can be eliminated with cooperative investment.]]></description><author>Bartkus, Viva &amp; Brooks, Wyatt J &amp; Kaboski, Joseph &amp; Pelnik, Carolyn</author></item><item><title>Electing Educated Leaders during Democratization: Evidence from Indonesia</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16486</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Using manufacturing plant-level census data from Indonesia, we show that the effect of democratization on manufacturing performance crucially depends on the education level of the newly elected local leaders. In districts that elect a mayor without college education, employment drops by five percent in the first few years after democratization, while employment stays constant under college-educated mayors. We also identify mechanisms: manufacturing plants in districts with non-college educated mayors face a much larger increase in local taxes, but also worse provision of local infrastructure and no extra spending on other public goods. A novel hand-collected dataset on corruption cases further suggests that democratic mayors without a college degree are more corrupt. Our estimates are plausibly causal since the year of local democratization varies exogenously across districts, and districts with different mayor education levels exhibit parallel trends in manufacturing prior to democratization.]]></description><author>Pelzl, Paul &amp; Poelhekke, Steven</author></item><item><title>Feed the children</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16482</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> To understand the household decision-making process regarding food expenditures for children in poor households in Nairobi, we conduct an experiment with 424 married couples. In the experiment, the spouses (individually and jointly) allocated money between themselves and nutritious meals for one of their children. First, we find strong empirical support for individual rationality and cooperative behavior. Second, our results suggest that women do not have stronger preferences for children's meals than men. Third, the spouses' respective bargaining positions derived from consumption patterns strongly correlate with more traditional indicators. Finally, we document significant heterogeneity both between individuals and intra-household decision processes.]]></description><author>Cherchye, Laurens &amp; Chiappori, Pierre-André &amp; De Rock, Bram &amp; Ringdal, Charlotte &amp; Vermeulen, Frederic</author></item><item><title>Testing Classic Theories of Migration in the Lab</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16469</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We test the predictions of different classic migration theories by using incentivized laboratory experiments to investigate how potential migrants decide between working in different destinations. We test theories of income maximization, migrant skill-selection, and multi-destination choice as we vary migration costs, liquidity constraints, risk, social benefits, and incomplete information. We show the standard income maximization model of migration with selection on observed and unobserved skills leads to a much higher migration rate and more negative skill-selection than is obtained when migration decisions take place under more realistic assumptions. Second, we investigate whether the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption holds. We find it holds for most people when decisions just involve wages, costs, and liquidity constraints. However, once we add a risk of unemployment and incomplete information, IIA no longer holds for about 20 percent of our sample.]]></description><author>Batista, Catia &amp; McKenzie, David J.</author></item><item><title>Forced Labor in Colonial Spanish America</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16467</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> The Spanish colonial empire initially faced a trilemma in the New World. First, they needed to incentivize quasi-private Spanish expeditions to subdue, settle, and secure new territories. Second, they needed labor to develop the new territories and provide a stream of rents for the imperial government. Third, they needed to ensure that the Spanish colonists did not grow powerful enough to challenge imperial authority. We show how the Spanish solved this trilemma in three ways, all involving forced labor: (1) transplanting Iberian institutions; (2) repurposing existing pre-Columbian institutions; (3) importing African slaves. We present evidence that over time forced labor in Spanish America underwent an endogenous process of decay as power slowly shifted from the Spanish-American colonial elite to indigenous labor. The end result was the increasing dominance of wage labor on the American mainland, leaving most forced labor arrangement either moribund or in decay by the time the empire collapsed. The commodity boom around the circum-Caribbean combined with geographic factors explains why this process was slower there (and short-circuited entirely in the case of Cuba).]]></description><author>Arroyo Abad, Leticia &amp; Maurer, Noel</author></item><item><title>North-South Displacement Effects of Environmental Regulation: The Case of Battery Recycling</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16463</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This study examines the effect of a tightening of the U.S. air-quality standard for lead in 2009 on the relocation of battery recycling to Mexico and on infant health in Mexico. In the U.S., airborne lead dropped sharply near affected plants, most of which were battery-recycling plants. Exports of used batteries to Mexico rose markedly. In Mexico, production increased at battery-recycling plants, relative to comparable industries, and birth outcomes deteriorated within two miles of those plants, relative to areas slightly farther away. The case provides a salient example of a pollution-haven effect between a developed and a developing country.]]></description><author>Tanaka, Shinsuke &amp; Teshima, Kensuke &amp; Verhoogen, Eric A</author></item><item><title>Oil Price Shocks and Conflict Escalation: Onshore vs. Offshore</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16454</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We reconsider the relationship between oil and conflict, focusing on the location of oil resources. In a panel of 132 countries over the period 1962-2009, we show that oil windfalls escalate conflict in onshore-rich countries, while they de-escalate conflict in offshore-rich countries. We use a model to illustrate how these opposite effects can be explained by a fighting capacity mechanism, whereby the government can use offshore oil income to increase its fighting capacity, while onshore oil may be looted by oppositional groups to finance a rebellion. We provide empirical evidence supporting this interpretation: we find that oil price windfalls increase both the number and strength of active rebel groups in onshore-rich countries, while they strengthen the government in offshore-rich ones.]]></description><author>Juel Andersen, Jørgen &amp; Nordvik, Frode Martin &amp; Tesei, Andrea</author></item><item><title>Shifting Punishment on Minorities: Experimental Evidence of Scapegoating</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16453</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper provides experimental evidence showing that members of a majority group systematically shift punishment on innocent members of an ethnic minority.  We develop a new incentivized task, the Punishing the Scapegoat Game, to measure how injustice affecting a member of one's own group shapes punishment of an unrelated bystander ("a scapegoat"). We manipulate the ethnic identity of the scapegoats and study interactions between the majority group and the Roma minority in Slovakia. We find that when no harm is done, there is no evidence of discrimination against the ethnic minority. In contrast, when a member of one's own group is harmed, the punishment "passed" on innocent individuals more than doubles when they are from the minority, as compared to when they are from the dominant group. These results illuminate how individualized tensions can be transformed into a group conflict, dragging minorities into conflicts in a way that is completely unrelated to their behavior.]]></description><author>Želinský, Tomáš &amp; Bauer, Michal &amp; Cahlikova, Jana &amp; Chytilova, Julie &amp; Roland, Gérard</author></item><item><title>How Much Do Norms Matter for Quantity and Quality of Children?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16445</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper quantifies the effect of social norms on fertility and children's education in Pakistan using a quantity-quality trade-off model augmented with the role of norms. The structural parameters of the theoretical model are estimated using stylized facts from an auxiliary econometric model. Quantitative analyses show that norms explain 49% of the variation in fertility and 31% of the variation in investment in the education of children among the households that differ in the mother's educational background and social class. The influence of norms is the weakest in households where women have tertiary education. The policies that provide economic incentives to encourage the education of children and control the population growth are less effective in the presence of norms. The cost of these policies is substantially lower when households are unaffected by norms, and the decline in cost varies with the education of the mothers in the target households.]]></description><author>Iftikhar, Zainab</author></item><item><title>Women's Well-being During a Pandemic and its Containment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16424</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> The COVID-19 pandemic brought the dual crises of disease and the containment policies designed to mitigate it. Yet, there is little evidence on the impacts of these policies on women, who are likely to be especially vulnerable, in lower-income countries. We conduct a large phone survey and leverage India's geographically-varying containment policies to estimate the association between both the pandemic and its containment policies, and measures of women's well-being, including mental health and food security. On aggregate, the pandemic resulted in dramatic income losses, increases in food insecurity, and declines in female mental health. While potentially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19 cases, we find that greater prevalence of containment policies is associated with increased food insecurity, particularly for women, and with reduced female mental health. Average containment levels are associated with a 39-40% increase in the likelihood of sadness, depression, and hopelessness among women and with an increase in the likelihood that women feel more worried by 45% of the variable mean. Particularly vulnerable groups of women, those with daughters and those living in female-headed households, experience larger declines in mental health.]]></description><author>Bau, Natalie &amp; Khanna, Gaurav &amp; Low, Corinne &amp; Shah, Manisha &amp; Sharmin, Sreyashi &amp; Voena, Alessandra</author></item><item><title>The Political-Economic Causes of the Soviet Great Famine, 1932-33</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16408</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This study constructs a large new dataset to investigate whether state policy led to ethnic Ukrainians experiencing higher mortality during the 1932-33 Soviet Great Famine. All else equal, famine (excess) mortality rates were positively associated with ethnic Ukrainian population share across provinces, as well as across districts within provinces. Ukrainian ethnicity, rather than the administrative boundaries of the Ukrainian republic, mattered for famine mortality. These and many additional results provide strong evidence that higher Ukrainian famine mortality was an outcome of policy, and suggestive evidence on the political-economic drivers of repression. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that bias against Ukrainians explains up to 77% of famine deaths in the three republics of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and up to 92% in Ukraine.]]></description><author>Markevich, Andrei &amp; Naumenko, Natalya &amp; Qian, Nancy</author></item><item><title>How Property Shapes Distributional Preferences</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16405</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We study how distributional preferences are affected by a major property rights reform that transformed informal use-rights over land traditionally characterizing rural Beninese villages in a system akin to private ownership. The design combines the randomized control-trial implementation of the reform across villages with lab-in-the-field experiments eliciting villagers' distributional choices -- both when luck is the source of situational inequality and when an unequal distribution is originated by merit considerations.  Results show that reforming allocation rules in the direction of impersonal market-alike institutions increases participants' acceptance of inequality determined by luck, while leaving  participants' tolerance for inequality generated by merit unaffected.]]></description><author>Bigoni, Maria &amp; Fabbri, Marco</author></item><item><title>Teacher Compensation and Structural Inequality: Evidence from Centralized Teacher School Choice in Peru</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16386</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This paper studies how increasing teacher compensation at hard-to-staff schools can reduce inequality in access to qualified teachers. Leveraging an unconditional change in the teacher compensation structure in Peru, we first show causal evidence that increasing salaries at less desirable locations attracts better quality applicants and improves student test scores. We then estimate a model of teacher preferences over local amenities, school characteristics, and wages using geocoded job postings and rich application data from the nationwide centralized teacher assignment system. Our estimated model suggests that the current policy is both ineâ??cient and not large enough to effectively undo the inequality of initial conditions that hard-to-staffâ??schools and their communities face. Counterfactual analyses that incorporate equilibrium sorting effects characterize alternative wage schedules and quantify the cost of reducing structural inequality in the allocation of teacher talent across schools.]]></description><author>Bobba, Matteo &amp; Ederer, Tim &amp; León-Ciliotta, Gianmarco &amp; Neilson, Christopher &amp; Nieddu, Marco</author></item><item><title>Machine Learning and Mobile Phone Data Can Improve the Targeting of Humanitarian Assistance</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16385</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), causing widespread food insecurity and a sharp decline in living standards. In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have mobilized targeted social assistance programs. Targeting is a central challenge in the administration of these programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify the individuals and families with the greatest need? This challenge is particularly acute in the large number of LMICs that lack recent and comprehensive data on household income and wealth. Here we show that non-traditional "big" data from satellites and mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of anti-poverty programs. Our approach uses traditional survey-based measures of consumption and wealth to train machine learning algorithms that recognize patterns of poverty in non-traditional data; the trained algorithms are then used to prioritize aid to the poorest regions and mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying Novissi, Togo's flagship emergency cash transfer program, which used these algorithms to determine eligibility for a rural assistance program that disbursed millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes â?? including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness â?? under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo at the time, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. Relative to methods that require a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise; no such registry exists in Togo), the machine learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9-35%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to contribute to humanitarian response efforts, particularly in crisis settings when traditional data are missing or out of date.]]></description><author>Aiken, Emily &amp; Bellue, Suzanne &amp; Blumenstock, Joshua &amp; Karlan, Dean S. &amp; Udry, Christopher</author></item><item><title>The Gender Pay Gap: Micro Sources and Macro Consequences</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16383</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We document that a large share of the gender pay gap in Brazil is due to women working at lower-paying employers. However, compared with that of men, women's revealed-preference ranking of employers is less increasing in pay. To interpret these facts, we develop an empirical equilibrium search model with endogenous gender differences in pay, amenities, and recruiting intensities across employers. The estimated model suggests that compensating differentials explain one-fifth of the gender pay gap, that there are significant output and welfare gains from eliminating gender differences, and that equal-treatment policies fail to close the gender pay gap.]]></description><author>Morchio, Iacopo &amp; Moser, Christian</author></item><item><title>Strategic or Confused Firms?

We estimate that 25% of firms are disadvantageous misreporters-they systematically misreport own sales and purchases such that their tax liability increases-while 75% are advantageous misreporters. Many firms-especially disadvantageous misreporters-fail to report imported inputs they themselves reported at Customs, increasing their VAT liability.

Heterogeneous firms sort into the formal or informal sector. We estimate the model using data from Brazil, and use counterfactual simulations to understand how trade affects economic outcomes in the presence of informality. We show that: (1) Trade openness unambiguously decreases informality in the tradable sector, but has ambiguous effects on aggregate informality. (2) The productivity gains from trade are understated when the informal sector is omitted. (3) Trade openness results in large welfare gains even when informality is repressed. (4) Repressing informality increases productivity, but at the expense of employment and welfare. (5) The effects of trade on wage inequality are reversed when the informal sector is incorporated in the analysis. (6) The informal sector works as an "unemployment," but not a "welfare buffer" in the event of negative economic shocks.]]></description><author>Dix-Carneiro, Rafael &amp; Goldberg, Pinelopi Koujianou &amp; Meghir, Costas &amp; Ulyssea, Gabriel</author></item></channel></rss>
