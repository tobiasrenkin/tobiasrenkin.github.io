We argue that innovation and autocracy can be mutually reinforcing when: (i) the new technology bolsters the autocrat's power; and (ii) the autocrat's demand for the technology stimulates further innovation in applications beyond those benefiting it directly. We test for such a mutually reinforcing relationship in the context of facial recognition AI in China. To do so, we gather comprehensive data on AI firms and government procurement contracts, as well as on social unrest across China during the last decade. We first show that autocrats benefit from AI: local unrest leads to greater government procurement of facial recognition AI, and increased AI procurement suppresses subsequent unrest. We then show that AI innovation benefits from autocrats' suppression of unrest: the contracted AI firms innovate more both for the government and commercial markets. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of sustained AI innovation under the Chinese regime: AI innovation entrenches the regime, and the regime's investment in AI for political control stimulates further frontier innovation.]]></description><author>Beraja, Martin &amp; Kao, Andrew &amp; Yang, David &amp; Yuchtman, Noam</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16703</guid></item><item><title>Urban Public Works in Spatial Equilibrium: Experimental Evidence from Ethiopia</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16691</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Abebe, Girum & Franklin, Simon & Imbert, Clément & Mejia-Mantilla, Carolina.</i> <p> <b>Monday, 01 11 2021.</b> <p> This paper evaluates Ethiopia's Urban Productive Safety Net Program, which provides employment on local public works to the urban poor, and was rolled out randomly across neighborhoods of Addis Ababa.  We find that the program increased public employment and reduced private labor supply among beneficiaries. We also show that it improved local amenities in treated locations, for both beneficiary and non-beneficiaries. We then develop a spatial equilibrium model and leverage unique data on commuting flows to quantify the effect of exposure to changes in labor supply from treated locations on labor markets across the city. Our estimates imply that once fully rolled out the program increased private wages by 18.6%. Finally, we use the model to compute the welfare gains to the poor: when we include the indirect effects on private wages and local amenities the welfare gains are four times larger than the direct benefits from public employment alone.]]></description><author>Abebe, Girum &amp; Franklin, Simon &amp; Imbert, Clément &amp; Mejia-Mantilla, Carolina</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16691</guid></item><item><title>A Note on the Global Distribution of Authorship in Economics Journals</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16676</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Greenspon, Jacob & Rodrik, Dani.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Using Fontana et al.'s (2019) database, we analyze levels and trends in the global distribution of authorship in economics journals, disaggregating by country/region, quality of journal, and fields of specialization. We document striking imbalances. While Western and Northern European authors have made substantial gains, the representation of authors based in low-income countries remains extremely low -- an order of magnitude lower than the weight of their countries or regions in the global economy. Developing country representation has risen fastest at journals rated 100th or lower, while it has barely increased in journals rated 25th or higher. Fields such as international or development where global diversification may have been expected have not experienced much increase in developing country authorship. These results are consistent with a general increase in the relative supply of research in the rest of the world. But they also indicate authors from developing countries remain excluded from the profession's top-rated journals.]]></description><author>Greenspon, Jacob &amp; Rodrik, Dani</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16676</guid></item><item><title>Water Treatment and Child Mortality: Evidence from Kenya</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16662</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Kremer, Michael.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Each year, around 500,000 children under 5 die from diarrhea, making it the third- leading cause of death in this age group. More than 80 percent of these deaths are attributable to unsafe drinking water. Drinking water can be made safe through dilute chlorine solution, but take-up of this technology has been low. Previous work has shown that free community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution through "dispensers" â?? reservoirs of chlorine solution at water sources that make chlorination easy and free â?? increases take-up of chlorination. However, it has remained unclear whether this increase also translates into reduced mortality. Here we show that four years of community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution in rural Kenya reduces all-cause under-5 mortality by 1.4 percentage points (95% CI: 0.3 pp, 2.5 pp), a 63% reduction relative to control.

These gaps seemingly imply frictions to human mobility. In this paper, we present new evidence on mobility within three African countries. We use a novel data source that provides highly detailed location data on more than one million smartphone devices across three large African countries for an entire year. This allows us to examine high-frequency mobility patterns for a subset of people for whom we can determine home locations confidently. The data offer insights into patterns of mobility, with corresponding implications for the nature and extent of mobility frictions. In particular, our data point to the ubiquity of relatively high-frequency journeys within countries -- i.e., visits. We observe that many users travel to  relatively distant within-country locations, with big cities acting as particularly attractive magnets. We develop a conceptual framework that characterizes the role of visits for individuals  and provides a number of testable predictions that are consistent with the movement patterns that we observe in the data. The analysis suggests that distance-linked mobility costs are not so high as to discourage travel. In fact, travel enables users to benefit from the opportunities that large cities provide, without having to incur the costs of relocation. The frictions sustaining spatial and sectoral gaps thus seem  to reflect deep fixed costs associated with the dislocations of migration and sectoral change, rather than the direct costs of movement.]]></description><author>Blanchard, Paul &amp; Gollin, Douglas &amp; Kirchberger, Martina</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16661</guid></item><item><title>Terms of Engagement: Migration, Dowry, and Love in Indian Marriages</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16659</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Beauchamp, Andrew & Calvi, Rossella & Fulford, Scott.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> The Indian marriage market is characterized by extensive female migration, sizable dowries, and the widespread practice of arranged marriage.

transfers induce interdependence in ex-ante adoption decisions. We characterize the
Nash equilibria of the insurance adoption game. We show that adoption decisions are
substitutes and that the number of adopters is unique in equilibrium. The demand for
formal insurance is lower with altruism than without at low prices, but higher at high
prices. Remarkably, individual incentives are aligned with social welfare. We extend

expected social returns to investing in parallel in multiple approaches to accelerating vaccination. We
argue there are high expected social returns to investigating the scope for lowering the dosage of some
COVID-19 vaccines. While existing evidence is not dispositive, available clinical data on the
immunogenicity of lower doses combined with evidence of a high correlation between neutralizing
antibody response and vaccine efficacy suggests that half- or even quarter-doses of some vaccines could
generate high levels of protection, particularly against severe disease and death, while potentially
expanding supply by 450 million to 1.55 billion doses per month, based on supply projections for 2021. An
epidemiological model suggests that even if fractional doses are less effective than standard doses,
vaccinating more people faster could substantially reduce total infections and deaths. The costs of further
testing alternative doses are much lower than the expected public health and economic benefits.
However, commercial incentives to generate evidence on fractional dosing are weak, suggesting that
testing may not occur without public investment. Governments could support either experimental or
observational evaluations of fractional dosing, for either primary or booster shots. Discussions with
researchers and government officials in multiple countries where vaccines are scarce suggest strong
interest in these approaches.]]></description><author>, Witold &amp; Ahuja, Amrita &amp; Chaudhuri, Esha &amp; Kremer, Michael &amp; Simoes Gomes Junior, Alexandre &amp; Snyder, Christopher &amp; Tabarrok, Alex &amp; Tan, Brandon</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16599</guid></item><item><title>Circles of Trust: Rival Information in Social Networks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16597</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Lee, Samuel & Persson, Petra & Roketskiy, Nikita.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We analyze the diffusion of rival information in a social network.

Larger loans generate small average impacts, but machine learning using psychometric data reveals dramatic heterogeneity. Top-performers (i.e., those with the highest predicted treatment effects) substantially increase profits, whereas profits for poor-performers drop. The magnitude of this difference implies that an individual lender's credit allocation choices matter for aggregate income. Evidence on two fronts suggests large loans would be misallocated: top-performers are predicted by loan officers to have higher default rates; and, top-performers grow less than others when given small loans, implying that allocating larger loans based on prior performance is not efficient. Our results have important implications for credit expansion policy and our understanding of entrepreneurial talent: on the former, the use of psychometric data to identify top-performers suggests a pathway towards better allocation that revolves around entrepreneurial type more than firm type; on the latter, the reversal of fortune for poor-performers, who do well with small loans but not large, indicates a type of entrepreneur that we call a "go-getter" who performs well when constrained but poorly when not.]]></description><author>Bryan, Gharad &amp; Karlan, Dean S. &amp; Osman, Adam</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16573</guid></item><item><title>Less School (Costs), More (Female) Education?

We find that the topology of transfer networks violate some of the predictions of both models. We then generalize the model of pure altruism to include caps on transfers that represent transaction costs, liquidity constraints, and social norms. Even with a parsimonious parametrization, the generalized model predicts equilibrium networks with topological features that match closely those of intra-village transfer networks in rural Gambia. Using a simulation-based indirect inference approach, we estimate the structural parameters of this model, relying only on income data and the topology of the transfer network for identification. We test for the existence of binding caps on transfers and find that network topologies are consistent

A quantitative exercise using a workhorse model of spatial equilibrium implies heterogeneous effects across locations, with aggregate real income gains reaching 2-3 percent in the long-run. Reductions in travel times increased local employment-to-population ratio but had no effect on local population. We extend the model by endogenizing the labor supply decision to capture this finding. The model-implied elasticity of employment rates to travel time reductions captures about one-third of the empirical elasticity.]]></description><author>Cosar, Kerem &amp; Demir, Banu &amp; Ghose, Devaki &amp; Young, Nathaniel</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16512</guid></item><item><title>Expansionary Austerity: Reallocating Credit Amid Fiscal Consolidation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16511</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Morais, Bernardo & Perez-Estrada, Javier & Peydró, José Luis & Ruiz-Ortega, Claudia.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> We show expansionary fiscal austerity via reallocation of credit supply, but with a raise in poverty.
For identification, we exploit the introduction of a Mexican law limiting the debt of subnational
governments along with matched credit register, firm, bank, and state datasets. After the law,
states with higher ex ante public debt grow substantially faster, despite larger fiscal consolidation
(higher taxes and lower public expenditure). Banks operating in more indebted states reallocate
credit supply away from local governments into private firms, with stronger effects for banks with
higher exposure to local public debt, consistent with lowering crowding out. Effects only happen
after the law, not before, and there are strong firm-level real effects associated. The reduction of
crowding out is stronger for financially constrained firms and for firms operating in states with
higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure projects. In states more
affected by the law, despite better economic effects, extreme poverty increases--especially in
states with higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure--consistent with
a strong reduction for social services during the fiscal consolidation.]]></description><author>Morais, Bernardo &amp; Perez-Estrada, Javier &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Ruiz-Ortega, Claudia</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16511</guid></item></channel></rss>
