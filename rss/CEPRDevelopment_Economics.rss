We argue that innovation and autocracy can be mutually reinforcing when: (i) the new technology bolsters the autocrat's power; and (ii) the autocrat's demand for the technology stimulates further innovation in applications beyond those benefiting it directly. We test for such a mutually reinforcing relationship in the context of facial recognition AI in China. To do so, we gather comprehensive data on AI firms and government procurement contracts, as well as on social unrest across China during the last decade. We first show that autocrats benefit from AI: local unrest leads to greater government procurement of facial recognition AI, and increased AI procurement suppresses subsequent unrest. We then show that AI innovation benefits from autocrats' suppression of unrest: the contracted AI firms innovate more both for the government and commercial markets. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of sustained AI innovation under the Chinese regime: AI innovation entrenches the regime, and the regime's investment in AI for political control stimulates further frontier innovation.]]></description><author>Beraja, Martin &amp; Kao, Andrew &amp; Yang, David &amp; Yuchtman, Noam</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16703</guid></item><item><title>Urban Public Works in Spatial Equilibrium: Experimental Evidence from Ethiopia</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16691</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> This paper evaluates Ethiopia's Urban Productive Safety Net Program, which provides employment on local public works to the urban poor, and was rolled out randomly across neighborhoods of Addis Ababa.  We find that the program increased public employment and reduced private labor supply among beneficiaries. We also show that it improved local amenities in treated locations, for both beneficiary and non-beneficiaries. We then develop a spatial equilibrium model and leverage unique data on commuting flows to quantify the effect of exposure to changes in labor supply from treated locations on labor markets across the city. Our estimates imply that once fully rolled out the program increased private wages by 18.6%. Finally, we use the model to compute the welfare gains to the poor: when we include the indirect effects on private wages and local amenities the welfare gains are four times larger than the direct benefits from public employment alone.]]></description><author>Abebe, Girum &amp; Franklin, Simon &amp; Imbert, Clément &amp; Mejia-Mantilla, Carolina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16691</guid></item><item><title>A Note on the Global Distribution of Authorship in Economics Journals</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16676</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Using Fontana et al.'s (2019) database, we analyze levels and trends in the global distribution of authorship in economics journals, disaggregating by country/region, quality of journal, and fields of specialization. We document striking imbalances. While Western and Northern European authors have made substantial gains, the representation of authors based in low-income countries remains extremely low -- an order of magnitude lower than the weight of their countries or regions in the global economy. Developing country representation has risen fastest at journals rated 100th or lower, while it has barely increased in journals rated 25th or higher. Fields such as international or development where global diversification may have been expected have not experienced much increase in developing country authorship. These results are consistent with a general increase in the relative supply of research in the rest of the world. But they also indicate authors from developing countries remain excluded from the profession's top-rated journals.]]></description><author>Greenspon, Jacob &amp; Rodrik, Dani</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16676</guid></item><item><title>Water Treatment and Child Mortality: Evidence from Kenya</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16662</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Each year, around 500,000 children under 5 die from diarrhea, making it the third- leading cause of death in this age group. More than 80 percent of these deaths are attributable to unsafe drinking water. Drinking water can be made safe through dilute chlorine solution, but take-up of this technology has been low. Previous work has shown that free community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution through "dispensers" â?? reservoirs of chlorine solution at water sources that make chlorination easy and free â?? increases take-up of chlorination. However, it has remained unclear whether this increase also translates into reduced mortality. Here we show that four years of community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution in rural Kenya reduces all-cause under-5 mortality by 1.4 percentage points (95% CI: 0.3 pp, 2.5 pp), a 63% reduction relative to control. We estimate that at USD 25 per DALY averted, free provision of chlorine solution is twenty times more cost- effective than the WHO "highly cost-effective" threshold]]></description><author>Kremer, Michael</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16662</guid></item><item><title>Perpetual Motion: Human Mobility and Spatial Frictions in Three African Countries</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16661</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Recent literature points to the importance in developing countries of spatial and sectoral gaps in wages and  living standards. These gaps seemingly imply frictions to human mobility. In this paper, we present new evidence on mobility within three African countries. We use a novel data source that provides highly detailed location data on more than one million smartphone devices across three large African countries for an entire year. This allows us to examine high-frequency mobility patterns for a subset of people for whom we can determine home locations confidently. The data offer insights into patterns of mobility, with corresponding implications for the nature and extent of mobility frictions. In particular, our data point to the ubiquity of relatively high-frequency journeys within countries -- i.e., visits. We observe that many users travel to  relatively distant within-country locations, with big cities acting as particularly attractive magnets. We develop a conceptual framework that characterizes the role of visits for individuals  and provides a number of testable predictions that are consistent with the movement patterns that we observe in the data. The analysis suggests that distance-linked mobility costs are not so high as to discourage travel. In fact, travel enables users to benefit from the opportunities that large cities provide, without having to incur the costs of relocation. The frictions sustaining spatial and sectoral gaps thus seem  to reflect deep fixed costs associated with the dislocations of migration and sectoral change, rather than the direct costs of movement.]]></description><author>Blanchard, Paul &amp; Gollin, Douglas &amp; Kirchberger, Martina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16661</guid></item><item><title>Terms of Engagement: Migration, Dowry, and Love in Indian Marriages</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16659</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> The Indian marriage market is characterized by extensive female migration, sizable dowries, and the widespread practice of arranged marriage. We develop and estimate a dynamic, general equilibrium, two-sided matching model with non-transferable utility to recover women's and men's preferences over spousal characteristics (such as age and education) and features of their marriage (including migration upon marriage, dowry payments, and women's involvement in the choice of their spouse).

We document an erosion of consumption insurance against both household-level idiosyncratic and village-level aggregate income shocks, and show that this decline is related to observable economic changes: the shift from agriculture to wage employment, the decline of publicly owned Township-and-Village Enterprises, and increased migrant work. Further evidence suggests that as these changes took place at the village level, higher levels of government failed to offset these effects through the tax-and-transfer system, leaving households more exposed to both idiosyncratic and village-aggregate shocks.]]></description><author>Attanasio, Orazio &amp; Meghir, Costas &amp; Mommaerts, Corina &amp; Zheng, Yu</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16654</guid></item><item><title>Mental Health Therapy as a Core Strategy for Increasing Human Capital: Evidence from Ghana</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16640</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We study the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for individuals selected from the general population of poor households in rural Ghana. Results from 2-3 months after a randomized intervention show strong impacts on mental and physical health, cognitive and socioemotional skills, and downstream economic outcomes. We find no evidence of heterogeneity by baseline mental distress; we
argue that this is because CBT can improve human capital for a general population of poor individuals through two pathways. First, CBT reduces vulnerability to deteriorating mental health; and second, CBT directly improves bandwidth, increasing cognitive and socioemotional skills and hence economic outcomes.]]></description><author>Barker, Nathan &amp; Bryan, Gharad &amp; Karlan, Dean S. &amp; Ofori-Atta, Angela &amp; Udry, Christopher</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16640</guid></item><item><title>Formal insurance and altruism networks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16621</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We study how altruism networks affect the adoption of formal insurance. Agents
have private CARA utilities and are embedded in a network of altruistic relationships.
Incomes are subject to both a common shock and a large idiosyncratic shock. Agents
can adopt formal insurance to cover the common shock. We show that ex-post altruistic
transfers induce interdependence in ex-ante adoption decisions. We characterize the
Nash equilibria of the insurance adoption game. We show that adoption decisions are
substitutes and that the number of adopters is unique in equilibrium. The demand for
formal insurance is lower with altruism than without at low prices, but higher at high
prices. Remarkably, individual incentives are aligned with social welfare. We extend
our analysis to CRRA utilities and to a fixed utility cost of adoption.]]></description><author>Bene, Tizié &amp; Bramoullé, Yann &amp; Deroïan, Frédéric</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16621</guid></item><item><title>Stunting and wasting in a growing economy: biological living standards in Portugal, 1924-1994</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16617</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Portugal's real income per head grew by a factor of eight during the second half of the twentieth century, a period of fast convergence towards Western European standards of living. We use a new sample of about 2,000 children to document trends in the prevalence of stunting and wasting in the city of Lisbon between 1945 and 1994. We find that stunting and wasting fell quickly in the 1950s and 1960s. This happened for males and females, and for infants (0 to 36 months of age) as well as children (2 to 10 years of age). We additionally use a sample of 17,000 young adult males covering the entire country which shows a similar decrease in the incidence of wasting and stunting, with the expected time lag. We discuss these trends in relation to changes in income and public policy which affected the ontogenetic environment of children.]]></description><author>Cermeño, Alexandra &amp; Palma, Nuno Pedro G. &amp; Pistola, Renato</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16617</guid></item><item><title>Women Legislators and Economic Performance</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16605</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> There has been a phenomenal global increase in the proportion of women in politics

leveraging close elections to isolate causal effects. We find significantly higher growth in

the impact of politician religion on abortion. Leveraging quasi-random variation in politician
religion generated by close elections in India and controlling for the party affiliation of politicians,
we find lower rates of sex-selective abortion in districts won by Muslim state legislators, consistent
with a higher reported aversion to abortion among Muslims compared to Hindus. The competing
hypothesis that this reflects weaker son preference among Muslims is undermined by stated
preference data and by demonstrating that fertility and girl-biased infant mortality increase in
Muslim-won districts.]]></description><author>Bhalotra, Sonia &amp; Clots-Figueras, Irma &amp; Iyer, Lakshmi</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16604</guid></item><item><title>Testing fractional doses of COVID-19 vaccines</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16599</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Due to the enormous economic, health, and social costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are high
expected social returns to investing in parallel in multiple approaches to accelerating vaccination. We
argue there are high expected social returns to investigating the scope for lowering the dosage of some
COVID-19 vaccines. While existing evidence is not dispositive, available clinical data on the
immunogenicity of lower doses combined with evidence of a high correlation between neutralizing
antibody response and vaccine efficacy suggests that half- or even quarter-doses of some vaccines could
generate high levels of protection, particularly against severe disease and death, while potentially
expanding supply by 450 million to 1.55 billion doses per month, based on supply projections for 2021. An
epidemiological model suggests that even if fractional doses are less effective than standard doses,
vaccinating more people faster could substantially reduce total infections and deaths. The costs of further
testing alternative doses are much lower than the expected public health and economic benefits.
However, commercial incentives to generate evidence on fractional dosing are weak, suggesting that
testing may not occur without public investment. Governments could support either experimental or
observational evaluations of fractional dosing, for either primary or booster shots. Discussions with
researchers and government officials in multiple countries where vaccines are scarce suggest strong
interest in these approaches.]]></description><author>, Witold &amp; Ahuja, Amrita &amp; Chaudhuri, Esha &amp; Kremer, Michael &amp; Simoes Gomes Junior, Alexandre &amp; Snyder, Christopher &amp; Tabarrok, Alex &amp; Tan, Brandon</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16599</guid></item><item><title>Circles of Trust: Rival Information in Social Networks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16597</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We analyze the diffusion of rival information in a social network.

We propose a novel corruption game to characterize the interaction between actual political leaders and citizens, and implement it in Northern Mozambique. Contrary to the game-theoretic prediction, both leaders and citizens engage in corruption. Importantly, corruption in the game is correlated with real-world corruption by leaders: citizens send bribes to leaders whom we observe appropriating community money, and these leaders are likely to reciprocate the bribes. In corrupt behavior, we identify an important trust dimension captured by a standard trust game.]]></description><author>Armand, Alex &amp; Coutts, Alexander &amp; Vicente, Pedro C &amp; Vilela, Inês</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16596</guid></item><item><title>De-escalation technology: the impact of body-worn cameras on citizen-police interactions</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16578</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We provide experimental evidence that monitoring of the police activity through body-worn cameras reduces use-of-force, handcuffs and arrests, and enhances criminal reporting.

Larger loans generate small average impacts, but machine learning using psychometric data reveals dramatic heterogeneity. Top-performers (i.e., those with the highest predicted treatment effects) substantially increase profits, whereas profits for poor-performers drop. The magnitude of this difference implies that an individual lender's credit allocation choices matter for aggregate income. Evidence on two fronts suggests large loans would be misallocated: top-performers are predicted by loan officers to have higher default rates; and, top-performers grow less than others when given small loans, implying that allocating larger loans based on prior performance is not efficient. Our results have important implications for credit expansion policy and our understanding of entrepreneurial talent: on the former, the use of psychometric data to identify top-performers suggests a pathway towards better allocation that revolves around entrepreneurial type more than firm type; on the latter, the reversal of fortune for poor-performers, who do well with small loans but not large, indicates a type of entrepreneur that we call a "go-getter" who performs well when constrained but poorly when not.]]></description><author>Bryan, Gharad &amp; Karlan, Dean S. &amp; Osman, Adam</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16573</guid></item><item><title>Less School (Costs), More (Female) Education?

We find that the topology of transfer networks violate some of the predictions of both models. We then generalize the model of pure altruism to include caps on transfers that represent transaction costs, liquidity constraints, and social norms. Even with a parsimonious parametrization, the generalized model predicts equilibrium networks with topological features that match closely those of intra-village transfer networks in rural Gambia. Using a simulation-based indirect inference approach, we estimate the structural parameters of this model, relying only on income data and the topology of the transfer network for identification. We test for the existence of binding caps on transfers and find that network topologies are consistent
with strong caps on transfers. Our structural estimates confirm that kinship is a strong predictor of altruistic preferences. We corroborate our structural estimates using proxies for transaction costs from surveys.]]></description><author>Fafchamps, Marcel &amp; Heß, Simon</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16561</guid></item><item><title>Entrepreneurial Motive, Ambiguity Attitudes and Willingness to Compete</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16559</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Different entrepreneurial motivations can lead to different business outcomes. The origins of these difference in outcomes are not well understood so far. In this study, we use a lab-in-the-field experiment to analyze how two distinct types of entrepreneurs handle the uncertainty of competition. Our subject pool includes people with real entrepreneurial experience, who either started a business out of necessity or who took an optional business opportunity. We test a treatment that boosts feelings of competence and whether ambiguity aversion or a-insensitivity moderate the treatment effect on willingness to compete. Our results indicate that necessity entrepreneurs are more likely to adjust their decision-making following the treatment.

We investigate this question for the case of Turkey, which undertook a large-scale public investment in roads during the 2000s. Using spatially disaggregated data on road upgrades and domestic transactions, we estimate a large positive impact of reduced travel times on trade as well as local manufacturing employment and wages. A quantitative exercise using a workhorse model of spatial equilibrium implies heterogeneous effects across locations, with aggregate real income gains reaching 2-3 percent in the long-run. Reductions in travel times increased local employment-to-population ratio but had no effect on local population. We extend the model by endogenizing the labor supply decision to capture this finding.

For identification, we exploit the introduction of a Mexican law limiting the debt of subnational
governments along with matched credit register, firm, bank, and state datasets. After the law,
states with higher ex ante public debt grow substantially faster, despite larger fiscal consolidation
(higher taxes and lower public expenditure). Banks operating in more indebted states reallocate
credit supply away from local governments into private firms, with stronger effects for banks with
higher exposure to local public debt, consistent with lowering crowding out. Effects only happen
after the law, not before, and there are strong firm-level real effects associated. The reduction of
crowding out is stronger for financially constrained firms and for firms operating in states with
higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure projects. In states more
affected by the law, despite better economic effects, extreme poverty increases--especially in
states with higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure--consistent with
a strong reduction for social services during the fiscal consolidation.]]></description><author>Morais, Bernardo &amp; Perez-Estrada, Javier &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Ruiz-Ortega, Claudia</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16511</guid></item><item><title>Understanding Chile's Social Unrest in an International Perspective</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16494</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Abstract
We aim to provide a broad descriptive overview of Chile's social issues, in comparison to other countries and over time, in order to place the recent social unrest in historical and international perspectives which can help prepare the ground for future policy priorities. We follow an eclectic approach, classifying a broad set of indicators along six dimensions-inequality across: i) income; ii) perception; iii) access; iv) opportunity; v) redistribution; and vi) location. The analysis puts forward a set of descriptive findings. First, income inequality declined substantially but remains high, also compared to countries with similar level and path of development. Second, Chile seems to be one of the few countries in Latin America with declining inequality where perceived inequality actually increased. Third, notwithstanding an increase in social spending, access to essential services appears limited, particularly for middle and lower income classes, amid fast growth of out-of-pocket health expenses, relatively faster growth of cost of living for the relatively poorer, and remaining weaknesses in the pension and education systems. Fourth, inequality of opportunity is high, with limited competition. Fifth, fiscal redistribution has improved markedly, but remains low by international standards. Finally, inter-regional inequality has declined substantially over the last two decades, reaching levels similar to the OECD median.]]></description><author>Hadzi-Vaskov, Metodij &amp; Ricci, Luca Antonio</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16494</guid></item><item><title>Countering misinformation with targeted messages: Experimental evidence using mobile phones</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16492</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Widespread misconceptions can be critical, especially in times of crisis. Through a field experiment, we study how to address such wrong or inaccurate beliefs using messages delivered to individual citizens using mobile phones. We focus on misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic in a hard-to-reach population â?? India's slum residents. We randomly allocate participants to receive voice and video messages introduced by a local citizen, the messenger, and in which medical practitioners debunk misconceptions. To understand the role of targeting, we randomly vary the signaled religious identity of the messenger into either Muslim or Hindu, guaranteeing exogenous variation in religion concordance between messenger and recipient.

In developing countries they help bring products from remote communities to end markets but may exert strong market power. We study a cooperative intervention which organizes together poor fishing communities in the Amazon --- one of the poorest and most remote regions of the world --- to purchase large boats in order to partially bypass middlemen and deliver their fish directly to market. We find that the intervention increases income by 27%, largely through an increase in price received, and also increases consumption. Moreover, the intervention is highly cost effective with the projected stream of income gains easily covering the cost of the investment. Finally, we formalize a model in which the market power of middlemen itself can create a poverty trap, which can be eliminated with cooperative investment.]]></description><author>Bartkus, Viva &amp; Brooks, Wyatt J &amp; Kaboski, Joseph &amp; Pelnik, Carolyn</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16487</guid></item><item><title>Electing Educated Leaders during Democratization: Evidence from Indonesia</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16486</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Using manufacturing plant-level census data from Indonesia, we show that the effect of democratization on manufacturing performance crucially depends on the education level of the newly elected local leaders. In districts that elect a mayor without college education, employment drops by five percent in the first few years after democratization, while employment stays constant under college-educated mayors. We also identify mechanisms: manufacturing plants in districts with non-college educated mayors face a much larger increase in local taxes, but also worse provision of local infrastructure and no extra spending on other public goods. A novel hand-collected dataset on corruption cases further suggests that democratic mayors without a college degree are more corrupt. Our estimates are plausibly causal since the year of local democratization varies exogenously across districts, and districts with different mayor education levels exhibit parallel trends in manufacturing prior to democratization.]]></description><author>Pelzl, Paul &amp; Poelhekke, Steven</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16486</guid></item><item><title>Feed the children</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16482</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> To understand the household decision-making process regarding food expenditures for children in poor households in Nairobi, we conduct an experiment with 424 married couples.

We test theories of income maximization, migrant skill-selection, and multi-destination choice as we vary migration costs, liquidity constraints, risk, social benefits, and incomplete information. We show the standard income maximization model of migration with selection on observed and unobserved skills leads to a much higher migration rate and more negative skill-selection than is obtained when migration decisions take place under more realistic assumptions. Second, we investigate whether the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption holds. We find it holds for most people when decisions just involve wages, costs, and liquidity constraints. However, once we add a risk of unemployment and incomplete information, IIA no longer holds for about 20 percent of our sample.]]></description><author>Batista, Catia &amp; McKenzie, David J.</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16469</guid></item><item><title>Forced Labor in Colonial Spanish America</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16467</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> The Spanish colonial empire initially faced a trilemma in the New World. First, they needed to incentivize quasi-private Spanish expeditions to subdue, settle, and secure new territories. Second, they needed labor to develop the new territories and provide a stream of rents for the imperial government. Third, they needed to ensure that the Spanish colonists did not grow powerful enough to challenge imperial authority. We show how the Spanish solved this trilemma in three ways, all involving forced labor: (1) transplanting Iberian institutions; (2) repurposing existing pre-Columbian institutions; (3) importing African slaves. We present evidence that over time forced labor in Spanish America underwent an endogenous process of decay as power slowly shifted from the Spanish-American colonial elite to indigenous labor. The end result was the increasing dominance of wage labor on the American mainland, leaving most forced labor arrangement either moribund or in decay by the time the empire collapsed. The commodity boom around the circum-Caribbean combined with geographic factors explains why this process was slower there (and short-circuited entirely in the case of Cuba).]]></description><author>Arroyo Abad, Leticia &amp; Maurer, Noel</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16467</guid></item><item><title>North-South Displacement Effects of Environmental Regulation: The Case of Battery Recycling</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16463</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This study examines the effect of a tightening of the U.S. air-quality standard for lead in 2009 on the relocation of battery recycling to Mexico and on infant health in Mexico.

In a panel of 132 countries over the period 1962-2009, we show that oil windfalls escalate conflict in onshore-rich countries, while they de-escalate conflict in offshore-rich countries. We use a model to illustrate how these opposite effects can be explained by a fighting capacity mechanism, whereby the government can use offshore oil income to increase its fighting capacity, while onshore oil may be looted by oppositional groups to finance a rebellion. We provide empirical evidence supporting this interpretation: we find that oil price windfalls increase both the number and strength of active rebel groups in onshore-rich countries, while they strengthen the government in offshore-rich ones.]]></description><author>Juel Andersen, Jørgen &amp; Nordvik, Frode Martin &amp; Tesei, Andrea</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16454</guid></item><item><title>Shifting Punishment on Minorities: Experimental Evidence of Scapegoating</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16453</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper provides experimental evidence showing that members of a majority group systematically shift punishment on innocent members of an ethnic minority.  We develop a new incentivized task, the Punishing the Scapegoat Game, to measure how injustice affecting a member of one's own group shapes punishment of an unrelated bystander ("a scapegoat"). We manipulate the ethnic identity of the scapegoats and study interactions between the majority group and the Roma minority in Slovakia. We find that when no harm is done, there is no evidence of discrimination against the ethnic minority. In contrast, when a member of one's own group is harmed, the punishment "passed" on innocent individuals more than doubles when they are from the minority, as compared to when they are from the dominant group. These results illuminate how individualized tensions can be transformed into a group conflict, dragging minorities into conflicts in a way that is completely unrelated to their behavior.]]></description><author>Želinský, Tomáš &amp; Bauer, Michal &amp; Cahlikova, Jana &amp; Chytilova, Julie &amp; Roland, Gérard</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16453</guid></item><item><title>How Much Do Norms Matter for Quantity and Quality of Children?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16445</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper quantifies the effect of social norms on fertility and children's education in Pakistan using a quantity-quality trade-off model augmented with the role of norms. The structural parameters of the theoretical model are estimated using stylized facts from an auxiliary econometric model. Quantitative analyses show that norms explain 49% of the variation in fertility and 31% of the variation in investment in the education of children among the households that differ in the mother's educational background and social class. The influence of norms is the weakest in households where women have tertiary education. The policies that provide economic incentives to encourage the education of children and control the population growth are less effective in the presence of norms. The cost of these policies is substantially lower when households are unaffected by norms, and the decline in cost varies with the education of the mothers in the target households.]]></description><author>Iftikhar, Zainab</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16445</guid></item><item><title>Women's Well-being During a Pandemic and its Containment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16424</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> The COVID-19 pandemic brought the dual crises of disease and the containment policies designed to mitigate it. Yet, there is little evidence on the impacts of these policies on women, who are likely to be especially vulnerable, in lower-income countries. We conduct a large phone survey and leverage India's geographically-varying containment policies to estimate the association between both the pandemic and its containment policies, and measures of women's well-being, including mental health and food security. On aggregate, the pandemic resulted in dramatic income losses, increases in food insecurity, and declines in female mental health. While potentially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19 cases, we find that greater prevalence of containment policies is associated with increased food insecurity, particularly for women, and with reduced female mental health. Average containment levels are associated with a 39-40% increase in the likelihood of sadness, depression, and hopelessness among women and with an increase in the likelihood that women feel more worried by 45% of the variable mean. Particularly vulnerable groups of women, those with daughters and those living in female-headed households, experience larger declines in mental health.]]></description><author>Bau, Natalie &amp; Khanna, Gaurav &amp; Low, Corinne &amp; Shah, Manisha &amp; Sharmin, Sreyashi &amp; Voena, Alessandra</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16424</guid></item><item><title>The Political-Economic Causes of the Soviet Great Famine, 1932-33</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16408</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This study constructs a large new dataset to investigate whether state policy led to ethnic Ukrainians experiencing higher mortality during the 1932-33 Soviet Great Famine. All else equal, famine (excess) mortality rates were positively associated with ethnic Ukrainian population share across provinces, as well as across districts within provinces. Ukrainian ethnicity, rather than the administrative boundaries of the Ukrainian republic, mattered for famine mortality. These and many additional results provide strong evidence that higher Ukrainian famine mortality was an outcome of policy, and suggestive evidence on the political-economic drivers of repression.

Leveraging an unconditional change in the teacher compensation structure in Peru, we first show causal evidence that increasing salaries at less desirable locations attracts better quality applicants and improves student test scores. We then estimate a model of teacher preferences over local amenities, school characteristics, and wages using geocoded job postings and rich application data from the nationwide centralized teacher assignment system. Our estimated model suggests that the current policy is both ineâ??cient and not large enough to effectively undo the inequality of initial conditions that hard-to-staffâ??schools and their communities face.

In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have mobilized targeted social assistance programs. Targeting is a central challenge in the administration of these programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify the individuals and families with the greatest need? This challenge is particularly acute in the large number of LMICs that lack recent and comprehensive data on household income and wealth. Here we show that non-traditional "big" data from satellites and mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of anti-poverty programs. Our approach uses traditional survey-based measures of consumption and wealth to train machine learning algorithms that recognize patterns of poverty in non-traditional data; the trained algorithms are then used to prioritize aid to the poorest regions and mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying Novissi, Togo's flagship emergency cash transfer program, which used these algorithms to determine eligibility for a rural assistance program that disbursed millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes â?? including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness â?? under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo at the time, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. Relative to methods that require a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise; no such registry exists in Togo), the machine learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9-35%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to contribute to humanitarian response efforts, particularly in crisis settings when traditional data are missing or out of date.]]></description><author>Aiken, Emily &amp; Bellue, Suzanne &amp; Blumenstock, Joshua &amp; Karlan, Dean S. &amp; Udry, Christopher</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16385</guid></item><item><title>The Gender Pay Gap: Micro Sources and Macro Consequences</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16383</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We document that a large share of the gender pay gap in Brazil is due to women working at lower-paying employers.

We estimate the model using data from Brazil, and use counterfactual simulations to understand how trade affects economic outcomes in the presence of informality. We show that: (1) Trade openness unambiguously decreases informality in the tradable sector, but has ambiguous effects on aggregate informality. (2) The productivity gains from trade are understated when the informal sector is omitted. (3) Trade openness results in large welfare gains even when informality is repressed. (4) Repressing informality increases productivity, but at the expense of employment and welfare. (5) The effects of trade on wage inequality are reversed when the informal sector is incorporated in the analysis. (6) The informal sector works as an "unemployment," but not a "welfare buffer" in the event of negative economic shocks.]]></description><author>Dix-Carneiro, Rafael &amp; Goldberg, Pinelopi Koujianou &amp; Meghir, Costas &amp; Ulyssea, Gabriel</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=-83459</guid></item></channel></rss>
