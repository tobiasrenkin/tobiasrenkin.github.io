We argue that innovation and autocracy can be mutually reinforcing when: (i) the new technology bolsters the autocrat's power; and (ii) the autocrat's demand for the technology stimulates further innovation in applications beyond those benefiting it directly. We test for such a mutually reinforcing relationship in the context of facial recognition AI in China. To do so, we gather comprehensive data on AI firms and government procurement contracts, as well as on social unrest across China during the last decade. We first show that autocrats benefit from AI: local unrest leads to greater government procurement of facial recognition AI, and increased AI procurement suppresses subsequent unrest. We then show that AI innovation benefits from autocrats' suppression of unrest: the contracted AI firms innovate more both for the government and commercial markets. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of sustained AI innovation under the Chinese regime: AI innovation entrenches the regime, and the regime's investment in AI for political control stimulates further frontier innovation.]]></description><author>Beraja, Martin &amp; Kao, Andrew &amp; Yang, David &amp; Yuchtman, Noam</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16703</guid></item><item><title>Economic Interests, Worldviews, and Identities: Theory and Evidence on Ideational Politics</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16699</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> We distinguish between ideational and interest-based appeals to voters on the supply side of politics, and integrate the Keynes-Hayek perspective on the importance of ideas with the Stigler-Becker approach emphasizing vested interests. In our model, political entrepreneurs discover identity and worldview "memes" (narratives, cues, frames) that shift beliefs about voters' identities or their views of how the world works. We identify a complementarity between worldview politics and identity politics and illustrate how they may reinforce each other. Furthermore, we show how adverse economic shocks may result in a greater incidence of ideational politics. We use these results to analyze data on 60,000 televised political ads in U.S. localities over the years 2000 through 2018. Our empirical work quantifies ideational politics and provides support for the key model implications, including the impact of higher inequality on both identity and worldview politics.]]></description><author>Ash, Elliott &amp; Mukand, Sharun &amp; Rodrik, Dani</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16699</guid></item><item><title>Without liberty and justice, what extremes to expect?

We first examine the support Binmore's game-theoretic treatment of Social Contracts provides for such a 'narrow corridor' of liberty and justice â?? and what extremes to expect without them. We also consider how the biological model of Competing Species helps to describe the dynamics of conflicting powers outside the narrow corridorâ?? where, as in contemporary Russia and China, any Social Contracts that exist are neither free nor fair.]]></description><author>Miller, Marcus &amp; Zissimos, Ben</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16695</guid></item><item><title>Cognitive Imprecision and Strategic Behavior</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16644</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We propose and experimentally test a theory of strategic behavior in which players are cognitively imprecise and perceive a fundamental parameter with noise. We focus on 2 x 2 coordination games, which generate multiple equilibria when perception is precise. When adding a small amount of cognitive imprecision to the model, we obtain a unique equilibrium where players use a simple cutoff strategy. The model further predicts that behavior is context-dependent: players implement the unique equilibrium strategy with noise, and the noise decreases in fundamental volatility. Our experimental data strongly support this novel prediction and reject several alternative game-theoretic models that do not predict context-dependence. We also find that subjects are aware of other players' imprecision, which is key to generating strategic uncertainty. Our framework has important implications for the literature on global games and, more broadly, illuminates the role of perception in generating both random and context-dependent behavior in games.]]></description><author>Frydman, Cary &amp; Nunnari, Salvatore</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16644</guid></item><item><title>Perceptions and Preferences for Redistribution</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16638</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> The relationship between the degree of inequality and the demand for redistribution has been a central question in political science and political economy. The famous median-voter model predicts that higher inequality, reflected in a growing gap between the income of the average and the median voter, should lead to increased demand for redistribution, as policymakers cater to the median voter's preferences (Meltzer and Richard, 1981). Yet, using data from OECD countries, Kenworthy and McCall (2008) show that, despite increases in inequality in those countries, there was no corresponding increase in demand for redistribution. Part of the explanation of this puzzle lies in the realization that it is not only (or even mainly) reality, but perceptions that shape support for policy. This article will explore recent evidence using large-scale social economics surveys and experiments that sheds lights on beliefs about inequality, social mobility, diversity and immigration, social position, and understanding of how policies work.]]></description><author>Stantcheva, Stefanie</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16638</guid></item><item><title>Visual Stereotypes in News Media</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16624</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We propose a new method for measuring gender and ethnic stereotypes in news reports. By combining computer vision and natural language processing tools, the method allows us to analyze both images and text and, crucially, the interaction between the two. We apply this approach to over 2 million web articles published in the New York Times and Fox News between 2000 and 2020. We find that in both outlets, men and whites are generally over-represented relative to their population share, while women and Hispanics are under-represented. News content perpetuates common stereotypes such as associating women with narratives about caring roles and family; Blacks and Hispanics with low-skill jobs, crime, and poverty; and Asians with high-skill jobs and science. There are some significant differences across outlets, with Fox's content displaying a stronger association of Hispanics with immigration than the New York Times. Finally, we find that group representation in the news is influenced by the gender and ethnic identity of authors and editors. This suggests that it results, at least in part, from the choices of news makers, and could change in response to increased diversity in newsroom staff.]]></description><author>Ash, Elliott &amp; Durante, Ruben &amp; Grebenshchikova, Mariia &amp; Schwarz, Carlo</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16624</guid></item><item><title>Women Legislators and Economic Performance</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16605</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> There has been a phenomenal global increase in the proportion of women in politics
in the last two decades, but there is no evidence of how this influences economic perfor-
mance. We investigate this using data on competitive elections to India's state assemblies,
leveraging close elections to isolate causal effects. We find significantly higher growth in
economic activity in constituencies that elect women and no evidence of negative spillovers
to neighbouring male-led constituencies, consistent with net growth. Probing mechanisms,
we â??find evidence consistent with women legislators being more efficacious, less corrupt and
less vulnerable to political opportunism.]]></description><author>Baskaran, Thushyanthan &amp; Bhalotra, Sonia &amp; Uppal, Yogesh</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16605</guid></item><item><title>Religion and Abortion: The Role of Politician Identity</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16604</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Debates around abortion typically invoke religion and politics but there is no causal evidence of
the impact of politician religion on abortion. Leveraging quasi-random variation in politician
religion generated by close elections in India and controlling for the party affiliation of politicians,
we find lower rates of sex-selective abortion in districts won by Muslim state legislators, consistent
with a higher reported aversion to abortion among Muslims compared to Hindus. The competing
hypothesis that this reflects weaker son preference among Muslims is undermined by stated
preference data and by demonstrating that fertility and girl-biased infant mortality increase in
Muslim-won districts.]]></description><author>Bhalotra, Sonia &amp; Clots-Figueras, Irma &amp; Iyer, Lakshmi</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16604</guid></item><item><title>Trust in Scientists in Times of Pandemic: Panel Evidence from 12 Countries</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16600</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> This article analyzes the specific and critical role of trust in scientists for both the support for and compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We exploit large-scale, longitudinal, and representative surveys for twelve countries over the period from March to December 2020, and we complement the analysis with experimental data. We find that trust in scientists is the key driving force behind individual support for and compliance with NPIs, and for favorable attitudes towards vaccination. The effect of trust in government is more ambiguous and tends to diminish support for and compliance with NPIs in countries where the recommendations from scientists and the government were not aligned. Trust in others also has seemingly paradoxical effects: in countries where social trust is high, the support for NPIs is low due to higher expectations that others will voluntary social distance. Our individual-level longitudinal data also allows us to evaluate the effects of within-person changes in trust over the pandemic: we show that trust levels, and in particular trust in scientists, have changed dramatically for individuals and within countries, with important subsequent effects on compliant behavior and support for NPIs. Such findings point out the challenging but critical need to maintain trust in scientists during a lasting pandemic that strains citizens and governments.]]></description><author>Algan, Yann &amp; Cohen, Daniel &amp; Davoine, Eva &amp; Foucault, Martial &amp; Stantcheva, Stefanie</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16600</guid></item><item><title>Democracy Doesn't Always Happen Over Night: Regime Change in Stages and Economic Growth</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16587</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> How substantial are the economic benefits from democratic regime change? We argue that democratisation is not a discrete event but a two-stage process: autocracies first enter into 'episodes' of political liberalization;  in the second stage, these episodes either culminate in regime change or not. Failure to account for this chronology and the implicit counterfactual groups risks biased estimates due to selection effects. Adopting a repeated-treatment difference-in-difference implementation, which captures non-parallel trends and selection into treatment, we find that a single event approach substantially underestimates the economic dividends from regime change and, crucially, obscures the permanent growth effect of democratisation.]]></description><author>Boese, Vanessa &amp; Eberhardt, Markus</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16587</guid></item><item><title>It Takes Money to Make MPs: New Evidence from 150 Years of British Campaign Spending</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16586</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We study electoral campaigns over the long run, through the lens of their spending. In particular, we ask whether changing media technologies and electoral environments impacted patterns of spending and their correlation with electoral results. To do so, we build a novel exhaustive dataset on general elections in the United Kingdom from 1857 to 2017, which includes information on campaign spending (itemized by expense categories), electoral outcomes and socio-demographic characteristics for 69,042 election-constituency-candidates. We start by providing new insights on the history of British political campaigns, in particular the growing importance of advertising material, including via digital means, to the detriment of paid staff and electoral meetings. We then show that there is a strong positive correlation between expenditures and votes, and that overall the magnitude of this relationship has strongly increased since the 1880s, with a peak in the last quarter of the 20th century. We link these transformations to changes in the conduct of campaigns, and to the introduction of new information technologies. We show in particular that the expansion of local radio and broadband Internet increased the sensitivity of the electoral results to differences in campaign spending. These results encourage greater contextualization in the drafting of campaign finance regulations.]]></description><author>Cagé, Julia &amp; Dewitte, Edgard</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16586</guid></item><item><title>When Interventions Fail: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in Latin America</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16585</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> On August 30, 2021, the United States completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan after a 20-year presence in the country. During the intervention, the Americans had tried to  improve the capacity of the Afghan state, maintain political stability, and end endemic political violence. While the U.S. intervention prevented violent extraconstitutional overthrows, it failed to improve Afghan state capacity or to end the war. The Afghan government fell to Taliban insurgents even before the Americans had fully departed. Afghanistan, however, was not the first American intervention that had these three aims. Over the first third of the 20th century, the U.S. intervened regularly across Latin America. We use this historical experience to test whether these earlier interventions produced similar outcomes and extract lessons. We find that U.S. interventions decreased state capacity but promoted political stability and peace --for only as long as American officials were present. The Afghan experience, despite the rapid fall of the regime, does not appear to be an outlier.]]></description><author>Arroyo Abad, Leticia &amp; Maurer, Noel</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16585</guid></item></channel></rss>
