We argue that innovation and autocracy can be mutually reinforcing when: (i) the new technology bolsters the autocrat's power; and (ii) the autocrat's demand for the technology stimulates further innovation in applications beyond those benefiting it directly. We test for such a mutually reinforcing relationship in the context of facial recognition AI in China. To do so, we gather comprehensive data on AI firms and government procurement contracts, as well as on social unrest across China during the last decade. We first show that autocrats benefit from AI: local unrest leads to greater government procurement of facial recognition AI, and increased AI procurement suppresses subsequent unrest. We then show that AI innovation benefits from autocrats' suppression of unrest: the contracted AI firms innovate more both for the government and commercial markets. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of sustained AI innovation under the Chinese regime: AI innovation entrenches the regime, and the regime's investment in AI for political control stimulates further frontier innovation.]]></description><author>Beraja, Martin &amp; Kao, Andrew &amp; Yang, David &amp; Yuchtman, Noam</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16703</guid></item><item><title>Profit Taxation, R&amp;D Spending, and Innovation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16702</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> We study how profit taxation affects plants' R&D spending and innovation activities. Relying on geocoded survey panel data which approximately covers the universe of R&D-active plants in Germany, we exploit around 7,300 changes in the municipal business tax rate over the period 1987â??2013 for identification. Applying event study models, we find a negative and statistically significant effect of an increase in profit taxation on plants' R&D spending with an implied long-run elasticity of -1.25. Reductions in R&D are particularly strong among more credit-constrained plants. In contrast, homogeneity of effects across the plant size distribution questions policy makers common practice to link targeted R&D tax incentives to plant size. We further find lagged negative effects on the (citation-weighted) number of filed patents.]]></description><author>Isphording, Ingo E. &amp; Lichter, Andreas &amp; Löffler, Max &amp; Nguyen, Thu-Van &amp; Poege, Felix &amp; Siegloch, Sebastian</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16702</guid></item><item><title>The Psychological Gains from COVID-19 Vaccination: Who Benefits the Most?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16694</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> We quantify the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on psychological well-being using information from a large-scale panel survey representative of the UK population. Exploiting exogenous variation in the timing of vaccinations, we find that vaccination increases psychological well-being by 0.12 standard deviation, compensating for around one half of the overall decrease caused by the pandemic. This effect persists for at least two months, and it is associated with a decrease in the perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and higher engagement in social activities. The improvement is 1.5 times larger for mentally distressed individuals, supporting the prioritization of this group in vaccination roll-outs.]]></description><author>Bagues, Manuel &amp; Dimitrova, Velichka</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16694</guid></item><item><title>Urban Public Works in Spatial Equilibrium: Experimental Evidence from Ethiopia</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16691</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> This paper evaluates Ethiopia's Urban Productive Safety Net Program, which provides employment on local public works to the urban poor, and was rolled out randomly across neighborhoods of Addis Ababa.  We find that the program increased public employment and reduced private labor supply among beneficiaries. We also show that it improved local amenities in treated locations, for both beneficiary and non-beneficiaries. We then develop a spatial equilibrium model and leverage unique data on commuting flows to quantify the effect of exposure to changes in labor supply from treated locations on labor markets across the city. Our estimates imply that once fully rolled out the program increased private wages by 18.6%. Finally, we use the model to compute the welfare gains to the poor: when we include the indirect effects on private wages and local amenities the welfare gains are four times larger than the direct benefits from public employment alone.]]></description><author>Abebe, Girum &amp; Franklin, Simon &amp; Imbert, Clément &amp; Mejia-Mantilla, Carolina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16691</guid></item><item><title>Women in Economics: Europe and the World</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16686</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> Based on a data set that we collected from the top research institutions in
economics around the globe (including universities, business schools and other organizations
such as central banks), we document the underrepresentation of women
in economics. For the 238 universities and business schools in the sample, women
hold 25% of senior level positions (full professor, associate professor) and 37% of
junior level positions. In the 82 U.S. universities and business schools, the figures
are 20% on the senior level and 32% on the entry level, while in the 122 European
institutions, the numbers are 27% and 38%, respectively, with some heterogeneity
across countries. The numbers also show that the highest-ranking institutions (in
terms of research output) have fewer women in senior positions. Moreover, in the
U.S., this effect is even present on the junior level. The "leaky pipeline" may hence
begin earlier than oftentimes assumed, and is even more of an issue in the highly
integrated market of the U.S. In Europe, an institution ranked 100 places higher
has three percentage points fewer women in senior positions, but in the U.S. it is
almost 5 percentage points.]]></description><author>Auriol, Emmanuelle &amp; Friebel, Guido &amp; Weinberger, Alisa &amp; Wilhelm, Sascha</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16686</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic coordination in efficient and fair strategies: a developmental perspective</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16683</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We study in the laboratory the behavior of children and adolescents (ages 7 to 16) in two repeated coordination games, the stag hunt and battle of the sexes. Coordinating on the efficient and fair long run outcome (EFO) requires participants to share intentions and beliefs. This exercise is arguably complex in the battle of the sexes, as it requires taking turns between the two static Nash equilibria, hence coordinating the strategies. By contrast, in the stag hunt it only requires repeating the action that leads to the Pareto efficient outcome, hence coordinating the actions. We obtain four main findings. First, for both games, we show a significant and remarkably stable increase in the ability to coordinate on the EFO with age. Second, the majority of participants in all ages adhere to one of a small number of relatively simple strategies. Third, jointly profitable outcomes are more prevalent in the stag hunt than in the battle of the sexes. Last, behavior improves between the first and second supergame. This evidence suggests that we gradually learn how to share intentions and beliefs, an ability that we train rapidly and export to new interactions, but that is limited by game complexity.]]></description><author>Brocas, Isabelle &amp; Carrillo, Juan D</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16683</guid></item><item><title>Multinationals' Sales and Profit Shifting in Tax Havens</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16675</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We show that U.S. multinationals record sales and the profit from these sales in tax havens, while their goods and services are physically sold in other countries. We propose a framework illustrating the strategy of sales shifting. Our results reveal the importance of tax havens which attract a disproportionate fraction of worldwide sales. Our quantification shows a large contribution of sales shifting to multinationals' profit shifting that amounts to $80bn in 2013.

closures from Burbio, we quantify the heterogeneous impact of school closures during the
Corona crisis on children affected at different ages and coming from households with different
parental characteristics. Our data suggests that secondary schools were closed for
in-person learning for longer periods than elementary schools (implying that younger children
experienced less school closures than older children), and that private schools experienced
shorter closures than public schools, and schools in poorer U.S. counties experienced
shorter school closures. We then extend the structural life cycle model of private and
public schooling investments studied in Fuchs-SchÃ¼ndeln, Krueger, Ludwig, and Popova
(2021) to include the choice of parents whether to send their children to private schools,
empirically discipline it with data on parental investments from the PSID, and then feed
into the model the school closure measures from our empirical analysis to quantify the
long-run consequences of the Covid-19 school closures on the cohorts of children currently
in school. Future earnings- and welfare losses are largest for children that started public
secondary schools at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. Comparing children from the top to
children from the bottom quartile of the income distribution, welfare losses are ca. 0.8
percentage points larger for the poorer children if school closures were unrelated to income.
Accounting for the longer school closures in richer counties reduces this gap by about 1/3.
A policy intervention that extends schools by 3 months (6 weeks in the next two summers)
generates significant welfare gains for the children and raises future tax revenues approximately
sufficient to pay for the cost of this schooling expansion.]]></description><author>Fuchs-Schündeln, Nicola &amp; Krueger, Dirk &amp; Kurmann, Andre &amp; Lale, Etienne &amp; Ludwig, Alexander &amp; Popova, Irina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16663</guid></item><item><title>A Safe Harbor: Wealth-Income Ratios in Switzerland Over the 20th Century and the Role of Housing Prices</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16660</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We estimate the ratio of private wealth to national income, Î²pt, for Switzerland over the period 1900â??2018. Our results indicate that the development of Î²pt in Switzerland did not follow a U-shaped pattern as in most European countries, but that the evolution was extraordinarily stable, with Î²pt oscillating around 500% over most of the 20th century. However, the wealth-income ratio has been on the rise since the turn of the century to reach 721% in 2017-a level unprecedented in the past. This considerable increase is mainly driven by large capital gains in housing wealth since 2010. We present new cross-country evidence that capital gains in housing wealth have become an important driver of rising wealth-income ratios in a series of developed economies.]]></description><author>Baselgia, Enea &amp; Martínez, Isabel Z.</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16660</guid></item><item><title>Growing Apart: Declining Within- and Across-Locality Insurance in Rural China</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16654</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We consider risk sharing in rural China during rapid economic transformation from the late 1980s through the late 2000s. We document an erosion of consumption insurance against both household-level idiosyncratic and village-level aggregate income shocks, and show that this decline is related to observable economic changes: the shift from agriculture to wage employment, the decline of publicly owned Township-and-Village Enterprises, and increased migrant work. Further evidence suggests that as these changes took place at the village level, higher levels of government failed to offset these effects through the tax-and-transfer system, leaving households more exposed to both idiosyncratic and village-aggregate shocks.]]></description><author>Attanasio, Orazio &amp; Meghir, Costas &amp; Mommaerts, Corina &amp; Zheng, Yu</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16654</guid></item><item><title>Post-Corona Balanced-Budget Super-Stimulus: The Case for Shifting Taxes onto Land</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16652</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> The post-Corona economic environment puts a premium on finding fiscal means to stimulate the economy while continuing to finance current levels of expenditures and debt. We develop and carefully calibrate a model of the US economy to show that an increase in the tax rate on the value of land, balanced by decreases in the tax rates on the incomes of capital and labor, can meet this need. We find that the US share of land in total nonfinancial assets is more than 50%, so that the tax base is very large. This is corroborated by very high quality OECD data for other industrialized economies that, almost without exception, find land shares of between 40% and 60%. Our baseline proposed tax reform is an increase in the tax rate on the asset value of land from its current 0.55% to 5.55%, accompanied by reductions in tax rates on capital and labor incomes of 28 and 10 percentage points, respectively. In a representative household model, this increases welfare by 3.4% of steady state consumption, and increases output by almost 15% relative to trend. In an economy with separate groups of workers, capitalists and landlords, the output gain is the same, while the welfare gain increases to 6.4% on average across the three groups. Welfare and output gains for a wealth tax that raises the same revenue, and which increases the tax rates on capital and land equally, are only half as large as the baseline. Welfare and output gains for an optimal tax reform, under the assumption that the tax rate on the value of land is capped at 20%, are approximately twice as large as the baseline. This reform raises 55% of all tax revenue through land taxes, with the remaining 45% raised through consumption taxes, while all income taxes are abolished.]]></description><author>Goodhart, Charles A &amp; Hudson, Michael &amp; Kumhof, Michael &amp; Tideman, Nicolaus</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16652</guid></item><item><title>The Financial Fragility of For-profit Hospitals: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16650</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We estimate the likelihood of financial distress of U.S. hospitals in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic using AHA Annual Survey data for 2011-2019 and smartphone mobility data for 2020. We find that while the average likelihood of distress across all hospitals is 28.53 % in 2020, slightly increasing from 2019, for-profit hospitals are much more likely to be distressed. Their average likelihood of financial distress is 39.13 %---a 6.93 percentage point increase from 2019. For-profit hospitals are the main providers of specialty health care services, such as psychiatric and acute long-term care, so their increased likelihood of distress poses a risk to service provision in these specialty areas, and particularly in rural communities. Our prediction model based on mobility data performs very well in sample against actual data and can potentially help policymakers and hospital administrators to monitor financial distress in real-time when case mixes change, or other large shocks materialize.]]></description><author>Bai, Ge &amp; Jiménez, Daniel &amp; Phan, Phillip &amp; Quintero, Luis &amp; Rebucci, Alessandro &amp; Sun, Xian</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16650</guid></item><item><title>Direct and Spillover Effects from Staggered Adoption of Health Policies: Evidence from Covid-19 Stay-at-Home Orders</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16649</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Local policies can have substantial spillovers both across geographies and markets. We estimate U.S. county level direct and spillover effects of Stay-at-Home-Orders (SHOs) aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 on mobility and social interaction measures. We propose a modified difference-in-difference regression design, based on contiguous-county triplets. This approach compares treated counties, which adopted the SHO, and neighbors, to the neighbor's neighbors, which we term hinterland, counties. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declined by a third to a half as much as in the treated locations. These spillover effects are concentrated in neighbors that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we decompose the spillover decline in mobility into reductions in external visits coming from the treated county and an even stronger voluntary decline in the neighbor county's own traffic. Together, our results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and illustrate the quantitative importance of voluntary social distancing. The finding that the estimated spillovers are in the same direction as the direct effects casts doubt on the prevailing narrative that a more nationally coordinated policy response would have accomplished a greater reduction in mobility and contacts.]]></description><author>Elenev, Vadim &amp; Quintero, Luis &amp; Rebucci, Alessandro &amp; Simeonova, Emilia</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16649</guid></item><item><title>The Geography of Job Creation and Job Destruction</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16645</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Spatial differences in labor market performance are large and highly persistent. Using data from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we document striking similarities in spatial differences in unemployment, vacancies, job finding, and job filling within each country. This robust set of facts guides and disciplines the development of a theory of local labor market performance. We find that a spatial version of a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model with endogenous separations and on-the-job search quantitatively accounts for all the documented empirical regularities. The model also quantitatively rationalizes why differences in job-separation rates have primary importance in
inducing differences in unemployment across space while changes in the job-finding rate are the main driver in unemployment fluctuations over the business cycle.]]></description><author>Kuhn, Moritz &amp; Manovskii, Iourii &amp; Qiu, Xincheng</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16645</guid></item><item><title>Spurring economic growth through human development: research results and guidance for policymakers</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16643</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Education, general health, and reproductive health are key indicators of human development. Investments in these domains can also promote economic growth. This paper argues for the importance of human development related investments based on i) a theoretical economic growth model with poverty traps, ii) a literature review of evidence that different human development related investments can promote growth, and iii) own empirical analyses that aim at estimating the relative contribution of different human development indicators to economic growth across heterogeneous growth regimes. Our results suggest the following associations: (i) a one-child decrease in the total fertility rate corresponds to a 2 percentage point (pp) increase in annual per capita GDP growth in the short run (5 years) and 0.5 pp higher annual growth in the mid to long run (35 years), (ii) a 10% increase in life expectancy at birth corresponds to a 1 pp increase in annual GDP per capita growth in the short run and 0.4 pp higher growth in the mid to long run, and (iii) a one-year increase in average educational attainment corresponds to a 0.7 pp increase in annual growth in the short run and 0.3 pp higher growth in the mid to long run.

The famous median-voter model predicts that higher inequality, reflected in a growing gap between the income of the average and the median voter, should lead to increased demand for redistribution, as policymakers cater to the median voter's preferences (Meltzer and Richard, 1981). Yet, using data from OECD countries, Kenworthy and McCall (2008) show that, despite increases in inequality in those countries, there was no corresponding increase in demand for redistribution. Part of the explanation of this puzzle lies in the realization that it is not only (or even mainly) reality, but perceptions that shape support for policy. This article will explore recent evidence using large-scale social economics surveys and experiments that sheds lights on beliefs about inequality, social mobility, diversity and immigration, social position, and understanding of how policies work.]]></description><author>Stantcheva, Stefanie</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16638</guid></item><item><title>The Return Expectations of Public Pension Funds</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16635</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> The return expectations of public pension funds are positively related to cross-sectional differences in past performance. This positive relation operates through the expected risk premium, rather than the expected risk-free rate or inflation rate.

Persistent investment skills, risk-taking, efforts to reduce costly rebalancing, and fiscal incentives from unfunded liabilities cannot fully explain the reliance of expectations on past performance.

At the end of World War II, a famine occurred abruptly in the Western Netherlands (November 1944 - May 1945), pushing the previously and subsequently well-nourished Dutch population to the brink of starvation. We link high-quality military recruits data with objective health measurements for the cohorts born in the years surrounding WWII with newly digitised historical records on calories and nutrient composition of the war rations, daily temperature, and warfare deaths. Using difference-in-differences and triple differences research designs, we show that the cohorts exposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter since early gestation have a higher Body Mass Index and an increased probability of being overweight at age 18, and that this effect is partly accounted for by warfare exposure and a reduction in energy-adjusted protein intake. Moreover, we account for selective mortality using a copula-based approach and newly-digitised data on survival rates, and find evidence of both selection and scarring effects. These results emphasise the complexity of the mechanisms at play in studying the consequences of early conditions.]]></description><author>Bijwaard, Govert E. &amp; Conti, Gabriella &amp; Ekamper, Peter &amp; Lumey, L.H. &amp; Poupakis, Stavros</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16633</guid></item><item><title>Mobility Responses to the Establishment of a Residential Tax Haven: Evidence From Switzerland</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16627</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> I analyze mobility responses to a tax reform that established the Swiss canton of Obwalden as a tax haven in 2006. The reform, which included a regressive income tax schedule, was explicitly aimed at attracting the top 1%. Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimations comparing Obwalden to all other cantons confirm that the reform successfully attracted rich taxpayers: by 2016, the share of rich in the canton had more than doubled, and average income per taxpayer was 16% higher relative to 2005. Using individual tax return data, I find a large elasticity of the stock of rich taxpayers of 1.5â??2 with respect to the net-of- average-tax rate. The corresponding flow elasticity is 7.2. To address potential endogeneity, I use a DiD approach to instrument the tax rate changes caused by the reform. Despite the large behavioral responses, the reform did not increase revenue per capita in the canton. Finally, I find small positive effects on local employment. However, rich in-movers were not more likely to also work in the canton, and I cannot rule out that employment effects were driven by the simultaneous reduction in corporate income taxes.]]></description><author>Martínez, Isabel Z.</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16627</guid></item><item><title>Visual Stereotypes in News Media</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16624</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We propose a new method for measuring gender and ethnic stereotypes in news reports. By combining computer vision and natural language processing tools, the method allows us to analyze both images and text and, crucially, the interaction between the two. We apply this approach to over 2 million web articles published in the New York Times and Fox News between 2000 and 2020. We find that in both outlets, men and whites are generally over-represented relative to their population share, while women and Hispanics are under-represented. News content perpetuates common stereotypes such as associating women with narratives about caring roles and family; Blacks and Hispanics with low-skill jobs, crime, and poverty; and Asians with high-skill jobs and science. There are some significant differences across outlets, with Fox's content displaying a stronger association of Hispanics with immigration than the New York Times. Finally, we find that group representation in the news is influenced by the gender and ethnic identity of authors and editors. This suggests that it results, at least in part, from the choices of news makers, and could change in response to increased diversity in newsroom staff.]]></description><author>Ash, Elliott &amp; Durante, Ruben &amp; Grebenshchikova, Mariia &amp; Schwarz, Carlo</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16624</guid></item><item><title>Racial Disparities in Access to Small Business Credit: Evidence from the Paycheck Protection Program</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16623</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We explore the sources of racial disparities in small business lending by studying the $806 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was designed to support small business jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. PPP loans were administered by private lenders but federally guaranteed, largely eliminating unobservable credit risk as a factor in explaining differential lending by race. We document that even after controlling for a firm's zip code, industry, loan size, PPP approval date, and other characteristics, Black-owned businesses were 12.1 percentage points (70% of the mean) more likely to obtain their PPP loan from a fintech lender than a traditional bank. Among conventional lenders, smaller banks were much less likely to lend to Black-owned firms, while the Top-4 banks exhibited little to no disparity after including controls. We use novel data to show that the disparity is not primarily explained by differences in pre-existing bank or credit relationships, firm financial positions, fintech affinity, or borrower application behavior. In contrast, we document that Black-owned businesses' higher rate of borrowing from fintechs compared to smaller banks is particularly large in places with high racial animus, pointing to a potential role for discrimination in explaining some of the racial disparities in small business lending. We find evidence that when small banks automate their lending processes, and thus reduce human involvement in the loan origination process, their rate of PPP lending to Black-owned businesses increases, with larger effects in places with more racial animus.]]></description><author>Howell, Sabrina &amp; Kuchler, Theresa &amp; Snitkof, David &amp; Ströbel, Johannes &amp; Wong, Jun</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16623</guid></item><item><title>Formal insurance and altruism networks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16621</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We study how altruism networks affect the adoption of formal insurance.

can adopt formal insurance to cover the common shock. We show that ex-post altruistic

Nash equilibria of the insurance adoption game. We show that adoption decisions are
substitutes and that the number of adopters is unique in equilibrium. The demand for
formal insurance is lower with altruism than without at low prices, but higher at high
prices. Remarkably, individual incentives are aligned with social welfare. We extend

At the time over 40% of openings on the nation's largest job-board specified a preferred gender.  Over the next year the fraction fell to under 5%. We merge data on filled vacancies to linked employer-employee data to study how the elimination of gender preferences affected hiring and job outcomes. Prior to the campaign, most stated preferences were concordant with the firm's existing gender composition, but a minority targeted the opposite gender - a subset we call non-stereotypical vacancies. Vacancies with a gender preference were very likely (>90%) to be filled by someone of that gender. We use pre-campaign vacancies to predict the probabilities of specifying preferences for females, males, or neither gender. We then conduct event studies of the effect of the campaign on the predicted groups. We find that the elimination of gender preferences led to a rise in the fraction of women hired for jobs likely to be targeted to men (and vice versa), increasing the diversity of hiring workplaces. Partially offsetting this effect, we find a reduction in the success of non-stereotypical vacancies in hiring the targeted gender, and indications of a decline in the efficiency of matching.  For the much larger set of stereotypical vacancies, however, vacancy filling times, wages, and job durations were largely unaffected by the campaign, suggesting that the elimination of stated preferences had at most small consequences on overall job match efficiency.]]></description><author>Card, David &amp; Colella, Fabrizio &amp; Lalive, Rafael</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16619</guid></item><item><title>The Effects of Taxes on Innovation: Theory and Empirical Evidence</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16608</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Income taxes are typically set to raise revenues and redistribute income at the lowest possible efficiency costs, which result from the distortions in individual behaviors that taxes entail. Individuals can respond along many margins, such as labor supply, tax avoidance and evasion, and geographic mobility. But one margin that taxes may affect - innovation - is less frequently considered. Conceptually, taxes reduce the expected net returns to innovation inputs and can reduce innovation. Much like other margins of responses to taxes, this efficiency cost must be taken into account. Innovation is done by a relatively small number of people, but it is nevertheless likely to have widespread benefits. While inventors may have divergent motivations, such as social recognition or the love of discovery, they also face an economic reality. How strongly innovation responds to taxes is an empirical question that has been the subject of a growing body of recent work. In this paper, I study how to account for innovation when setting personal income and capital taxation. I distinguish between two cases: one in which the government can set a differentiated tax on inventors and one in which the government is constrained to set the same tax on all agents. I provide a model that flexibly accounts for the spillovers generated by innovation and the non-pecuniary benefits inventors receive from innovation and derive tax formulas expressed in terms of estimable sufficient statistics. The second part of the paper discusses the empirical evidence on the effects of taxes on the quantity, quality, and location of innovation, as well as tax avoidance and income shifting done through innovation.]]></description><author>Stantcheva, Stefanie</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16608</guid></item><item><title>Comparing European healthcare systems</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16602</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the effects on health system performance of health policy choices related to efficiency, quality and competition and use recent data from Eurostat and OECD to verify the predictions.

Introducing a regulator specifically for healthcare quality and making provider quality reports public are associated with improved outcomes. In terms of competition, allowing patients to choose their provider leads to lower mortality. But in terms of insurer competition, single payer systems tend to do better than multiple insurers, especially in countries where inpatient care is predominantly delivered by public hospitals.]]></description><author>Boone, Jan</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16602</guid></item><item><title>Trust in Scientists in Times of Pandemic: Panel Evidence from 12 Countries</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16600</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> This article analyzes the specific and critical role of trust in scientists for both the support for and compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We exploit large-scale, longitudinal, and representative surveys for twelve countries over the period from March to December 2020, and we complement the analysis with experimental data. We find that trust in scientists is the key driving force behind individual support for and compliance with NPIs, and for favorable attitudes towards vaccination. The effect of trust in government is more ambiguous and tends to diminish support for and compliance with NPIs in countries where the recommendations from scientists and the government were not aligned. Trust in others also has seemingly paradoxical effects: in countries where social trust is high, the support for NPIs is low due to higher expectations that others will voluntary social distance. Our individual-level longitudinal data also allows us to evaluate the effects of within-person changes in trust over the pandemic: we show that trust levels, and in particular trust in scientists, have changed dramatically for individuals and within countries, with important subsequent effects on compliant behavior and support for NPIs. Such findings point out the challenging but critical need to maintain trust in scientists during a lasting pandemic that strains citizens and governments.]]></description><author>Algan, Yann &amp; Cohen, Daniel &amp; Davoine, Eva &amp; Foucault, Martial &amp; Stantcheva, Stefanie</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16600</guid></item><item><title>Testing fractional doses of COVID-19 vaccines</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16599</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Due to the enormous economic, health, and social costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are high
expected social returns to investing in parallel in multiple approaches to accelerating vaccination. We
argue there are high expected social returns to investigating the scope for lowering the dosage of some
COVID-19 vaccines. While existing evidence is not dispositive, available clinical data on the
immunogenicity of lower doses combined with evidence of a high correlation between neutralizing
antibody response and vaccine efficacy suggests that half- or even quarter-doses of some vaccines could
generate high levels of protection, particularly against severe disease and death, while potentially
expanding supply by 450 million to 1.55 billion doses per month, based on supply projections for 2021. An
epidemiological model suggests that even if fractional doses are less effective than standard doses,
vaccinating more people faster could substantially reduce total infections and deaths. The costs of further
testing alternative doses are much lower than the expected public health and economic benefits.
However, commercial incentives to generate evidence on fractional dosing are weak, suggesting that
testing may not occur without public investment. Governments could support either experimental or
observational evaluations of fractional dosing, for either primary or booster shots. Discussions with
researchers and government officials in multiple countries where vaccines are scarce suggest strong
interest in these approaches.]]></description><author>, Witold &amp; Ahuja, Amrita &amp; Chaudhuri, Esha &amp; Kremer, Michael &amp; Simoes Gomes Junior, Alexandre &amp; Snyder, Christopher &amp; Tabarrok, Alex &amp; Tan, Brandon</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16599</guid></item><item><title>Measuring corruption in the field using behavioral games</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16596</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Corruption is often harmful for economic development, yet it is difficult to measure due to its illicit nature.

Contrary to the game-theoretic prediction, both leaders and citizens engage in corruption. Importantly, corruption in the game is correlated with real-world corruption by leaders: citizens send bribes to leaders whom we observe appropriating community money, and these leaders are likely to reciprocate the bribes.

We hypothesize that employers coerce victims into silence through the threat of a retaliatory firing, and test this theory by estimating whether external shocks that reduce the value of a worker's outside options exacerbate underreporting. Under mild assumptions, a rise in the severity of formal complaints is indicative of increased underreporting. Combining this insight with an objective measure of the quality of charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), we perform two analyses. First, we assess whether workers report sexual harassment more selectively during recessions, when outside labor market options are limited. We estimate the fraction of sexual harassment charges deemed to have merit by the EEOC increases by 0.5-0.7% for each one percentage point increase in a state-industry's monthly unemployment rate. The effect is amplified in industries employing a larger fraction of men and in establishments with a higher share of male managers. Second, we test whether less generous UI benefits create economic incentives for victims of workplace sexual harassment to remain silent. We find the selectivity of sexual harassment charges increases by more than 30% in response to a 50% cut to North Carolina's Unemployment Insurance (UI) program following the Great Recession.]]></description><author>Dahl, Gordon &amp; Knepper, Matthew</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16577</guid></item><item><title>The Rise of the Educated Class</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16572</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Recent decades have seen dramatic developments in Western countries, which happened in a number of areas, political, economic and social.

Imperfect substitution between inputs allows for general equilibrium effects. We consider any type of cross-base responses to tax changes such as income-shifting. Formalizing the tax schedule as the sum of many one-dimensional schedules, we express optimal marginal tax rate on any kind of income in terms of sufficient statistics, including new ones for cross-base responses and general equilibrium effects. We also identify the conditions under which making the personal income tax marginally more schedular is socially desirable. The comprehensive and schedular (dual, in particular) income taxes being recurring proposals in the public debate, we derive sufficient conditions under which each form of tax is optimal. We stress how empirically restrictive these conditions are. Using a new algorithm on French tax return data, we characterize the optimal combination of a nonlinear tax schedule on personal income and a linear tax rate on capital income. We find that one should include, without any deduction, all income sources in the personal income base and subsidize the source of income which is more elastic. We find that crossbase responses have little effects on the personal nonlinear income tax schedule but increases by 5.9 to 6.9 percentage points the capital tax rate. General equilibrium effects also increases this tax rate by around 4.5 percentage points.]]></description><author>Jacquet, Laurence &amp; Lehmann, Etienne</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16571</guid></item><item><title>The impact of common law on the volume of legal services: An international study</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16565</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We show that the heavy use of legal services relative to output in the US is not a peculiarity of the country but applies to common law countries in general.

Conflicts of interest between these two groups may give rise to pandering in policymaking. We expand the standard pandering setup in two directions. First,  we allow for policies to differ in their complexity. Second, we model the dynamic consequences of reforms, where a complex (simple) policy complexifies (simplifies) the legislative environment in which subsequent policies are drafted. We show that pandering motivates inefficient complex policies, which beget complexity in the legislative environment. We derive conditions under which the complexity build-up is bounded. Stabilization around an intermediate level of complexity is achieved under high uncertainty around the type of policy reform suited to current conditions and around the bureaucracy's capacity to implement it. When complex reforms are expected to be the right ones but bureaucratic capacity is uncertain, the legislative environment may enter a trap of ever increasing complexity.]]></description><author>Foarta, Dana &amp; Morelli, Massimo</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16562</guid></item><item><title>The Welfare Economics of Reference Dependence</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16560</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Empirical evidence suggests individuals often evaluate options relative to a reference point, especially seeking to avoid losses.

hours worked and firm employment) more in small and young firms, which are more financially
constrained. Within small and young firms, the wage effects accrue to incumbent workers,
in line with the back-loaded wage mechanism. Consistent with the capital-skill complementarity
mechanism, we document an increase in skill premium and show that financially constrained
firms increase both physical and human capital investment by most. Our findings uncover
a central role for both the firm-balance sheet and the bank lending channels of the monetary
policy transmission to labor income inequality, with state-dependent effects that are substantially
stronger during crisis times. Importantly, we do not find any redistributive effects for firms

We intentionally oversample Black respondents, cover many US cities, and survey both adults and young people of ages 13 through 17. In the experimental parts, we consider the causal impact of information on racial inequities (such as the evolution of the Black-white earnings gap or the differences in mobility for Black and white children) and explanations for these inequities (i.e., the deep-seated roots and long-lasting consequences of systemic racism) on respondents' views. Although there is heterogeneity in how respondents perceive the magnitude of current racial gaps in economic conditions and opportunities, the biggest discrepancies are in how they explain them. There is a stark partisan gap among white respondents, particularly in the perceived causes of racial inequities and what should be done about them. White Democrats and Black respondents are much more likely to attribute racial inequities to adverse past and present circumstances and want to act on them with race-targeted and general redistribution policies. White Republicans are more likely to attribute racial gaps to individual actions. These views are already deeply entrenched in teenagers, based on their race and their parents' political affiliation.

We suggest that a successful new paradigm must provide the basis of a dynamic and sustainable economy and be constituted by a synergistic set of ethical commitments, economic models, emblematic policies, and a new vernacular economics by which people understand and seek to improve their livelihoods and futures. We illustrate these four components by reference to the classical liberal, Keynesian-social democratic, and neoliberal paradigms.

For identification, we exploit the introduction of a Mexican law limiting the debt of subnational

states with higher ex ante public debt grow substantially faster, despite larger fiscal consolidation
(higher taxes and lower public expenditure). Banks operating in more indebted states reallocate
credit supply away from local governments into private firms, with stronger effects for banks with
higher exposure to local public debt, consistent with lowering crowding out. Effects only happen
after the law, not before, and there are strong firm-level real effects associated. The reduction of
crowding out is stronger for financially constrained firms and for firms operating in states with
higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure projects. In states more
affected by the law, despite better economic effects, extreme poverty increases--especially in
states with higher ex ante public spending on social services over infrastructure--consistent with

Better organizational practices improve productivity and the potential taxable profits of firms. However, higher adoption of these practices may also enable more efficient allocation of profits across tax jurisdictions, lowering actual taxable profits. We present new evidence that MNE subsidiaries with better such practices, when located in high-tax countries, report significantly lower profits and have a higher incidence of bunching around zero returns on assets. We show these results are driven by patterns consistent with profit-shifting behavior. Further, using an event study design, we find that firms with better practices are more responsive to corporate tax rate changes.

In recessions, rather than propping up marginal (new hires') costs of labor, rigid average wages squeeze cash flows, forcing firms to cut hiring due to financial constraints. Indeed, empirical cash flows and profits would turn acyclical if wages were only moderately more procyclical. I study this channel in a search and matching model with financial constraints and rigid wages among incumbent workers, while new hires' wages are flexible. Individually, each feature generates no amplification. By contrast, their interaction can account for much of the empirical labor market fluctuations--breaking the neutrality of incumbents' wages for hiring, and showing that financial amplification of business cycles requires wage rigidity.]]></description><author>Schoefer, Benjamin</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16499</guid></item><item><title>Countering misinformation with targeted messages: Experimental evidence using mobile phones</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16492</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Widespread misconceptions can be critical, especially in times of crisis.

We randomly allocate participants to receive voice and video messages introduced by a local citizen, the messenger, and in which medical practitioners debunk misconceptions. To understand the role of targeting, we randomly vary the signaled religious identity of the messenger into either Muslim or Hindu, guaranteeing exogenous variation in religion concordance between messenger and recipient. Doctor messages are effective at increasing knowledge of, and compliance with, COVID-19 policy guidelines. Changes in misconceptions are observed only when there is religion concordance and mainly for religious-salient misconceptions.

We then explore whether and how comparisons with peers or others (i.e. reference groups) shape their preferences for redistribution.

We can include both preference factors, affecting individuals' preferences over private and public goods, and match quality factors, driving differences in unobserved match quality.

In this paper, we analyze the migration response of American workers to two of the most important shocks that hit US manufacturing since the late 1990s - Chinese import competition and the introduction of industrial robots. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in exposure across US local labor markets over time, we show that robots caused a sizable reduction in population size, while Chinese imports did not. We rationalize these results in two steps. First, we provide evidence that negative employment spillovers outside manufacturing, caused by robots but not by Chinese imports, are an important mechanism for the different migration responses triggered by the two shocks. Next, we present a model where workers are geographically mobile and compete with either machines or foreign labor in the completion of tasks. The model highlights that two key dimensions along which the shocks differ - the cost savings they provide and the degree of complementarity between directly and indirectly exposed industries - can explain their disparate employment effects outside manufacturing and, in turn, the differential migration response.]]></description><author>Faber, Marius &amp; Sarto, Andres &amp; Tabellini, Marco</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16460</guid></item><item><title>Shifting Punishment on Minorities: Experimental Evidence of Scapegoating</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16453</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper provides experimental evidence showing that members of a majority group systematically shift punishment on innocent members of an ethnic minority.

We manipulate the ethnic identity of the scapegoats and study interactions between the majority group and the Roma minority in Slovakia. We find that when no harm is done, there is no evidence of discrimination against the ethnic minority. In contrast, when a member of one's own group is harmed, the punishment "passed" on innocent individuals more than doubles when they are from the minority, as compared to when they are from the dominant group. These results illuminate how individualized tensions can be transformed into a group conflict, dragging minorities into conflicts in a way that is completely unrelated to their behavior.]]></description><author>Želinský, Tomáš &amp; Bauer, Michal &amp; Cahlikova, Jana &amp; Chytilova, Julie &amp; Roland, Gérard</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16453</guid></item><item><title>OECD Pension Reform: it is the business cycle, not the demography!</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16451</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Using a new real-time dataset from Beetsma et al.

Many rules and arrangements seek to insulate such individuals from public pressure or to address the effects of such pressure. We study this subject empirically, investigating the circumstances in which public pressure is more and less likely to affect judging.

Using detailed data from the Bundesliga, Germany's top soccer league, our analysis of how crowd pressure affects the decisions of referees yields two key insights. First, we show that crowd pressure biases referee's decisions in favor of the home team for those decisions that cannot be unambiguously identified as erroneous but not for those decisions that can. In particular, a referee exhibits a bias in favor of the home team with respect to more subjective decisions such as the showing of yellow cards (cautions), which is based on the referee's judgment, but not with respect to more objective decisions such as validating goals and awarding penalty kicks, where live TV coverage often allows for objective identification of errors.

Second, we show that the effect of crowd pressure on referee decisions depends on the extent to which such pressure is viewed by the referee as understandable or reasonable (or even justified). Specifically, a referee's bias in favor of the home team in yellow card issuance is strengthened after the referee makes an objectively identifiable error against the home team and thus might view crowd heckling as understandable. This effect is stronger when the referee's error is costlier to the home team because the game is more important or the error is more consequential due to the closeness of the game at the time of the error.

The introduction of VAR (Video Assistant Referee) technology in 2017 and the restrictions imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic, which caused games to be played without crowds, allow us to test our results under three different regimes (pre-VAR, VAR, and VAR/no-crowd). Inspection of the results under these three different regimes serves to reinforce them. As expected, VAR reduces the number of referee errors, but the pattern of no bias with respect to errors is preserved. VAR has no effect on the number of yellow cards, or on the number of goals. Once the crowd disappears, so does the home advantage in goals. Referee errors are unaffected, but the home bias with respect to yellow cards disappears as well. This confirms the effect that the crowd has on referees' more subjective decisions.]]></description><author>Cohen, Alma</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16427</guid></item><item><title>How to Communicate the Nudge: A Real-World Policy Experiment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16426</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Disclosure-based Nudges are being increasingly utilized by governments around the world to achieve policy goals related to health, safety, employment, environmental protection, retirement savings, credit, debt and more. And, yet, a critical aspect of these Nudge-type policy interventions-the mode of communication-remains unexplored. What is the best way to communicate information to individuals-by letter, by phone call (or voice message), by email, by text message or video message? We begin to answer this basic question using a real-world policy experiment on debt collection procedures. Debtors often lack adequate information about the debt, the judgment, and the enforcement and collection procedures. As a result, the process of debt collection is often harmful to the debtor and ineffective in securing repayment. We conducted a study (N = 36,362), in cooperation with the Israeli Ministry of Justice, to improve communication with debtors and to evaluate the effect of such improved communication strategies on collection procedures and outcomes. A novelty of this study is our focus on the choice of medium-telephone, regular mail, text message and video message-holding fixed the content of the communication. We found that digital communication strategies, specifically communicating via text message, were the most cost-effective, significantly improving outcomes for both debtors and creditors. Our results should inform the choice of communication mediums in the many settings in which disclosure-based Nudge policies are employed.]]></description><author>Bar-Gill, Oren &amp; Cohen, Alma</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16426</guid></item><item><title>Should We Insure Workers or Jobs During Recessions?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16421</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> What is the most efficient way to respond to recessions in the labor market?
To this question, policymakers on both sides of the pond gave two diametrically
opposed answers during the recent crisis. In the US, the focus was on insuring
workers, by aggressively increasing the generosity of unemployment insurance
(UI). In Europe, to the contrary, policies were concentrated on saving job matches,
with the massive use of labor hoarding subsidies through short-time-work (STW)
programs, on which so little is actually known. In this article, we try to understand
who got it right. Building on the vast literature on UI and on a recent stream of
papers on STW, we first provide a framework to determine the relative welfare
effects of STW versus UI. We then show that UI offers more insurance value than
STW, but tends to exhibit larger fiscal externalities, due to moral hazard. We finally
focus on how STW and UI affect labor market equilibrium and how this interacts
with inefficiencies in the labor market. We review recent evidence showing that
STW can be an effective way to reduce socially costly layoffs in recessions. Overall,
we conclude that STW is an important and useful addition to the labor market
policy-toolkit during recessions, with strong and positive complementarities with
UI.]]></description><author>Giupponi, Giulia &amp; Landais, Camille &amp; Lapeyre, Alice</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16421</guid></item><item><title>Retirement Consumption and Pension Design</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16420</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper develops and implements a framework that leverages consumption
data to evaluate the welfare effects of pension reforms. Several countries have reformed
their pension profiles to incentivize later retirement. Using administrative
data in Sweden, we find that such pension reforms entail substantial consumption
smoothing costs. On average, individuals retiring later have higher consumption
levels than those retiring earlier, implying that recent pension reforms redistributed
from low- to high-consumption households. We show that the differences
in retirement consumption are mostly driven by differential changes in consumption
around retirement, and also that the marginal propensities to consume are
the lowest for late retirees. Accounting for selection on health and life expectancy
further increases the redistributive cost of recent reforms. The cost of incentivizing
later retirement is, however, lowest between the early and normal retirement
age, where we document a striking non-monotonicity in consumption levels. We
find similar patterns in consumption data from other countries, including the nonmonotonicity,
suggesting our findings are not unique to Sweden.]]></description><author>Kolsrud, Jonas &amp; Landais, Camille &amp; Reck, Daniel &amp; Spinnewijn, Johannes</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16420</guid></item><item><title>Mothers at Work: How Mandating Paid Maternity Leave Affects Employment, Earnings and Fertility</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16418</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> In July 2005, Switzerland introduced the first federal paid maternity leave mandate, offering 14 weeks of leave with 80% of pre-birth earnings.

Women covered by the mandate worked and earned more during pregnancy, and also had temporarily increased job continuity with their pre-birth employer after birth. Estimated effects on other labor market outcomes are small or absent, and all dissipate by five years after birth. The mandate instead persistently increased subsequent fertility: affected women were three percentage points more likely to have a second child in the next nine years.

long-term outcomes ranging from physical and mental health problems, to labour market outcomes and welfare use. We combine novel regression analysis of rich data from the National Child Development Study and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing with secondary evidence to produce an incidence-based estimate of the lifetime costs of child maltreatment from a societal perspective. The discounted average lifetime incidence cost of non-fatal child maltreatment by a primary caregiver is estimated at Â£89,390 (95% uncertainty interval Â£44,896 to Â£145,508); the largest contributors to this are costs from social care, short-term health and long-term labour market outcomes. The discounted lifetime cost per death from child maltreatment is estimated at Â£940,758, comprising health care and lost productivity costs.

MN increases future production, as notified workers search on the job, but reduces current production as they supply less effort. Our theoretical model captures this trade-off and predicts that MN improves production efficiency by increasing information sharing, whereas large production losses can be avoided by worker-firm agreements on side-payments â?? severance pay â?? in lieu of MN. We provide evidence of such severance increases in response to an extension of MN using novel Swedish administrative data. We then estimate the production gain of MN: extending the MN period leads to shorter non-employment duration and higher reemployment wages, plausibly driven by on-the-job search. Using variation in notice duration across firms, we estimate the productivity loss of notice. The estimates of benefits and costs suggest that MN has a positive net impact on production, offering an empirically-grounded efficiency argument for mandating notice.]]></description><author>Cederlöf, Jonas &amp; Fredriksson, Peter &amp; Nekoei, Arash &amp; Seim, David</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16387</guid></item><item><title>Teacher Compensation and Structural Inequality: Evidence from Centralized Teacher School Choice in Peru</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16386</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This paper studies how increasing teacher compensation at hard-to-staff schools can reduce inequality in access to qualified teachers.

We then estimate a model of teacher preferences over local amenities, school characteristics, and wages using geocoded job postings and rich application data from the nationwide centralized teacher assignment system. Our estimated model suggests that the current policy is both ineâ??cient and not large enough to effectively undo the inequality of initial conditions that hard-to-staffâ??schools and their communities face. Counterfactual analyses that incorporate equilibrium sorting effects characterize alternative wage schedules and quantify the cost of reducing structural inequality in the allocation of teacher talent across schools.]]></description><author>Bobba, Matteo &amp; Ederer, Tim &amp; León-Ciliotta, Gianmarco &amp; Neilson, Christopher &amp; Nieddu, Marco</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16386</guid></item><item><title>Machine Learning and Mobile Phone Data Can Improve the Targeting of Humanitarian Assistance</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16385</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), causing widespread food insecurity and a sharp decline in living standards. In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have mobilized targeted social assistance programs. Targeting is a central challenge in the administration of these programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify the individuals and families with the greatest need? This challenge is particularly acute in the large number of LMICs that lack recent and comprehensive data on household income and wealth. Here we show that non-traditional "big" data from satellites and mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of anti-poverty programs. Our approach uses traditional survey-based measures of consumption and wealth to train machine learning algorithms that recognize patterns of poverty in non-traditional data; the trained algorithms are then used to prioritize aid to the poorest regions and mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying Novissi, Togo's flagship emergency cash transfer program, which used these algorithms to determine eligibility for a rural assistance program that disbursed millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes â?? including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness â?? under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo at the time, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. Relative to methods that require a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise; no such registry exists in Togo), the machine learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9-35%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to contribute to humanitarian response efforts, particularly in crisis settings when traditional data are missing or out of date.]]></description><author>Aiken, Emily &amp; Bellue, Suzanne &amp; Blumenstock, Joshua &amp; Karlan, Dean S. &amp; Udry, Christopher</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16385</guid></item><item><title>Pandemic Lockdown: The Role of Government Commitment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16384</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This paper studies lockdown policy in a dynamic economy without government commitment. Lockdown imposes a cap on labor supply, which improves health prospects at the cost of economic output and consumption. A government would like to commit to the extent of future lockdowns in order to guarantee an economic outlook that supports efficient levels of investment into intermediate inputs. However, such a commitment is not credible, since investments are sunk at the time when the government chooses a lockdown. As a result, lockdown under lack of commitment deviates from the optimal policy. Rules that limit a government's lockdown discretion can improve social welfare, even in the presence of noncontractible information. Quantitatively, lack of commitment causes lockdown to be significantly more severe than is socially optimal. The output and consumption loss due to lack of commitment is greater for higher intermediate input shares, higher discount rates, higher values of life, higher disease transmission rates at and outside of work, and longer vaccine arrival times.]]></description><author>Moser, Christian &amp; Yared, Pierre</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16384</guid></item><item><title>The Gender Pay Gap: Micro Sources and Macro Consequences</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16383</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We document that a large share of the gender pay gap in Brazil is due to women working at lower-paying employers. However, compared with that of men, women's revealed-preference ranking of employers is less increasing in pay. To interpret these facts, we develop an empirical equilibrium search model with endogenous gender differences in pay, amenities, and recruiting intensities across employers. The estimated model suggests that compensating differentials explain one-fifth of the gender pay gap, that there are significant output and welfare gains from eliminating gender differences, and that equal-treatment policies fail to close the gender pay gap.]]></description><author>Morchio, Iacopo &amp; Moser, Christian</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16383</guid></item><item><title>Gay Politics Goes Mainstream: Democrats, Republicans, and Same-Sex Relationships</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16382</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> Attitudes towards same-sex relationships in the US have changed radically over a
relatively short period of time. After remaining fairly constant for over two decades,
opinions became more favorable starting in 1992 - a presidential election year in which
the Democratic and Republican parties took opposing stands over the status of gay
people in society. What roles did political parties and their leaders play in this process
of cultural change? Using a variety of techniques including machine learning, we show
that the partisan opinion gap emerged substantially prior to 1992 -- in the mid 1980s
-- and did not increase as a result of the political debates in 1992-'93. Furthermore,
we identify people with a college-and-above education as the potential "leaders" of the
process of partisan divergence.]]></description><author>Fernández, Raquel &amp; Parsa, Sahar</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16382</guid></item><item><title>Progressive Pensions as an Incentive for Labor Force Participation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16380</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> In this paper, we challenge the conventional idea that an increase in the progressivity of old-age pensions unanimously distorts the labor supply decision of households. So far, the literature has argued that higher pension progressivity leads to more redistribution and insurance provision on the one hand, but increases implicit taxes and therefore distorts labor supply choices on the other. In contrast, we show that a well-designed reform of the pension system has the potential to encourage labor force participation. We propose a progressive pension component linked to the employment decision of households,  which implicitly subsidizes employment of the productivity poor. A simulation analysis in a quantitative stochastic overlapping generations model with productivity and longevity risk indicates that this positive employment effect can be sizable and welfare enhancing.]]></description><author>Kindermann, Fabian &amp; Pueschel, Veronika</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16380</guid></item><item><title>Strategic or Confused Firms?

Using transaction-level data from Ugandan value-added tax (VAT) returns, we show that sellers and buyers report different amounts 79% of the time, despite invoices being easily cross-checked. We estimate that 25% of firms are disadvantageous misreporters-they systematically misreport own sales and purchases such that their tax liability increases-while 75% are advantageous misreporters. Many firms-especially disadvantageous misreporters-fail to report imported inputs they themselves reported at Customs, increasing their VAT liability. On net, unilateral VAT misreporting cost Uganda about US$384 million in foregone 2013-2016 tax revenue.]]></description><author>Almunia, Miguel &amp; Hjort, Jonas &amp; Knebe, Justine &amp; Tian, Lin</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16379</guid></item></channel></rss>
