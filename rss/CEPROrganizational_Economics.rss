The principal anticipates receiving private information and must hire an agent to take an action on her behalf. Contracts can only specify a limited number of actions as a function of the state. The principal is at liberty not to specify actions for some of the states. States not covered by the contract induce a communication game.  We show that close alignment of interests favors communication and, thus, ceding authority to the agent, while strong misalignment favors reliance on contracts. In the uniform-quadratic environment  whenever an optimal contract induces influential communication, it splits the communication region: there are at least two communication actions separated by contract actions. For sufficiently closely aligned interests, it is also the case that communication splits the contract region: there are at least two contract actions separated by a communication action.
The separation of distinct communication events relaxes incentive compatibility constraints and, therefore, helps equalize the size of communication events. This highlights the dual role of contracting as both substituting for and facilitating communication -- the principal uses contracts not only to impose her favorite actions, but also to structure communication.]]></description><author>Blume, Andreas &amp; Deimen, Inga &amp; Inoue, Sean</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16697</guid></item><item><title>Women in Economics: Europe and the World</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16686</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Auriol, Emmanuelle & Friebel, Guido & Weinberger, Alisa & Wilhelm, Sascha.</i> <p> <b>Monday, 01 11 2021.</b> <p> Based on a data set that we collected from the top research institutions in
economics around the globe (including universities, business schools and other organizations
such as central banks), we document the underrepresentation of women
in economics. For the 238 universities and business schools in the sample, women
hold 25% of senior level positions (full professor, associate professor) and 37% of
junior level positions. In the 82 U.S. universities and business schools, the figures
are 20% on the senior level and 32% on the entry level, while in the 122 European
institutions, the numbers are 27% and 38%, respectively, with some heterogeneity
across countries. The numbers also show that the highest-ranking institutions (in
terms of research output) have fewer women in senior positions. Moreover, in the
U.S., this effect is even present on the junior level. The "leaky pipeline" may hence
begin earlier than oftentimes assumed, and is even more of an issue in the highly
integrated market of the U.S. In Europe, an institution ranked 100 places higher
has three percentage points fewer women in senior positions, but in the U.S. it is
almost 5 percentage points.]]></description><author>Auriol, Emmanuelle &amp; Friebel, Guido &amp; Weinberger, Alisa &amp; Wilhelm, Sascha</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16686</guid></item><item><title>How Do Acquisitions Affect the Mental Health of Employees?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16657</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Bach, Laurent & Baghai, Ramin P. & Bos, Marieke & Silva, Rui C.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Using employer-employee level data linked to individual health records, we document that the incidence of stress, anxiety, depression, psychiatric medication usage, and even suicide increase following acquisitions. These effects are prevalent among employees from both targets and acquirers, in weak as well as in growing, profitable firms. Employees who experience negative career developments within the merging firms, 'blue-collar' workers, and employees with lower cognitive and non-cognitive skills are most affected. A variety of tests address endogeneity concerns, including an analysis exploiting failed mergers. Our findings point to mental illness as a significant non-pecuniary cost of acquisitions.]]></description><author>Bach, Laurent &amp; Baghai, Ramin P. &amp; Bos, Marieke &amp; Silva, Rui C</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16657</guid></item><item><title>Intelligence Disclosure and Cooperation in Repeated Interactions</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16656</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Lambrecht, Marco & Proto, Eugenio & Rustichini, Aldo & Sofianos, Andis.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We investigate in a laboratory setting whether revealing information on intelligence affects behavior in games with repeated interactions. In our experimental design we communicate information on the cognitive ability of both players. We use three stage games: Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) and two versions of Battle of Sexes (BoS), with high and low payoff inequality. We find that the information affects strategic behavior significantly in two distinct ways. 
In PD, disclosure markedly hampers cooperation, as higher intelligence players are less cooperative once they are made aware that they play against someone of lower ability than themselves in the disclosure treatment. Similarly, in BoS with low payoff inequality, disclosure disrupts coordination on outcomes with positive payoffs, as higher intelligence players try to force their most preferred outcome onto the less intelligent. 
However, in BoS with high payoff inequality, this pattern of behavior dramatically changes. Disclosure does not significantly affect coordination rates. Differently from the low payoff inequality game,  coordination is achieved more often on outcomes that favor less intelligent players. We conjecture that when coordination becomes more difficult, because of the high inequality between payoffs, intelligence and inequality together form a coordination device.]]></description><author>Lambrecht, Marco &amp; Proto, Eugenio &amp; Rustichini, Aldo &amp; Sofianos, Andis</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16656</guid></item><item><title>Selecting Valuation Distributions: Non-Price Decisions of Multi-Product Firms</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16655</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Bossard, Stefanie & Schmutzler, Armin.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> This paper analyzes decisions of multi-product firms regarding product selection, innovation and advertising as choices of consumer valuation distributions. We show that a profit-maximizing monopolist chooses these distributions so as to maximize the dispersion of the valuation differences between goods across consumers. By contrast, she chooses the willingness-to-pay to be maximally or minimally dispersed, depending on the set of available distributions. In our benchmark model with uniform valuation differences, prices are increasing in valuation difference heterogeneity, but in more general settings this is not necessarily true. Moreover, the relation between willingness-to-pay heterogeneity and prices may well be non-monotone. Over wide parameter ranges, the firm's choice of valuation distribution does not maximize net consumer surplus. This problem is exacerbated when the firm has access to strategies that distort valuation heterogeneity or willingness-to-pay heterogeneity.]]></description><author>Bossard, Stefanie &amp; Schmutzler, Armin</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16655</guid></item><item><title>Relational Contracts and Trust in a High-Tech Industry</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16653</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Calzolari, Giacomo & Felli, Leonardo & Koenen, Johannes & Spagnolo, Giancarlo & Stahl, Konrad O.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We study how informal buyer-supplier relationships in the German automotive industry aï¬?ect procurement. Using unique data from a survey focusing on these, we show that more trust, the belief that the trading partner acts to maintain the mutual relationship, is associated with both higher quality of the automotive parts and more competition among suppliers. Yet both eï¬?ects hold only for parts involving unsophisticated technology, not when technology is sophisticated. We rationalize these ï¬?ndings within a relational contracting model that critically focuses on changes in the bargaining power, due to diï¬?erences in the costs of switching suppliers.]]></description><author>Calzolari, Giacomo &amp; Felli, Leonardo &amp; Koenen, Johannes &amp; Spagnolo, Giancarlo &amp; Stahl, Konrad O</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16653</guid></item><item><title>Circles of Trust: Rival Information in Social Networks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16597</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Lee, Samuel & Persson, Petra & Roketskiy, Nikita.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We analyze the diffusion of rival information in a social network. In our model, rational agents can share information sequentially, unconstrained by an exogenous protocol or timing. We show how to compute the set of eventually informed agents for any network, and show that it is essentially unique under altruistic preferences.

We propose a novel corruption game to characterize the interaction between actual political leaders and citizens, and implement it in Northern Mozambique. Contrary to the game-theoretic prediction, both leaders and citizens engage in corruption. Importantly, corruption in the game is correlated with real-world corruption by leaders: citizens send bribes to leaders whom we observe appropriating community money, and these leaders are likely to reciprocate the bribes. In corrupt behavior, we identify an important trust dimension captured by a standard trust game.]]></description><author>Armand, Alex &amp; Coutts, Alexander &amp; Vicente, Pedro C &amp; Vilela, Inês</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16596</guid></item><item><title>Do Peer Preferences Matter in School Choice Market Design?

students to express their preferences over both programs and peers? Theoretically, we show
that a stable matching exists with peer preferences under mild conditions, but finding one via
canonical mechanisms is unlikely. We show that increasing transparency about the previous
cohort of students enrolling at each program induces a tÃ¢tonnement process wherein the distributions
of former student types play the role of prices. We theoretically model this process
and develop a test for match stability. We implement this test empirically in the college admissions
market in New SouthWales (NSW), Australia, where we find evidence of preferences
over relative peer ability. We show that the NSW market fails to converge to stability over time.
We propose a new mechanism that improves upon the current design, and we show that this
mechanism generates a stable matching in the NSW market.]]></description><author>Bachas, Natalie Marie &amp; Fonseca, Ricardo &amp; Pakzad-Hurson, Bobby</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16544</guid></item><item><title>Information Payoffs: An Interim Perspective</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16543</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Doval, Laura & Smolin, Alex.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> We study the payoffs that can arise under some information structure from an interim perspective. There is a set of types distributed according to some prior distribution and a payoff function that assigns a value to each pair of a type and a belief over the types. Any information structure induces an interim payoff profile which describes, for each type, the expected payoff under the information structure conditional on the type. We characterize the set of all interim payoff profiles consistent with some information structure.
