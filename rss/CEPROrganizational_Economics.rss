The principal anticipates receiving private information and must hire an agent to take an action on her behalf. Contracts can only specify a limited number of actions as a function of the state. The principal is at liberty not to specify actions for some of the states. States not covered by the contract induce a communication game.  We show that close alignment of interests favors communication and, thus, ceding authority to the agent, while strong misalignment favors reliance on contracts. In the uniform-quadratic environment  whenever an optimal contract induces influential communication, it splits the communication region: there are at least two communication actions separated by contract actions. For sufficiently closely aligned interests, it is also the case that communication splits the contract region: there are at least two contract actions separated by a communication action.
The separation of distinct communication events relaxes incentive compatibility constraints and, therefore, helps equalize the size of communication events. This highlights the dual role of contracting as both substituting for and facilitating communication -- the principal uses contracts not only to impose her favorite actions, but also to structure communication.]]></description><author>Blume, Andreas &amp; Deimen, Inga &amp; Inoue, Sean</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16697</guid></item><item><title>Women in Economics: Europe and the World</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16686</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> Based on a data set that we collected from the top research institutions in
economics around the globe (including universities, business schools and other organizations
such as central banks), we document the underrepresentation of women
in economics. For the 238 universities and business schools in the sample, women
hold 25% of senior level positions (full professor, associate professor) and 37% of
junior level positions. In the 82 U.S. universities and business schools, the figures
are 20% on the senior level and 32% on the entry level, while in the 122 European
institutions, the numbers are 27% and 38%, respectively, with some heterogeneity
across countries. The numbers also show that the highest-ranking institutions (in
terms of research output) have fewer women in senior positions. Moreover, in the
U.S., this effect is even present on the junior level. The "leaky pipeline" may hence
begin earlier than oftentimes assumed, and is even more of an issue in the highly
integrated market of the U.S. In Europe, an institution ranked 100 places higher
has three percentage points fewer women in senior positions, but in the U.S. it is
almost 5 percentage points.]]></description><author>Auriol, Emmanuelle &amp; Friebel, Guido &amp; Weinberger, Alisa &amp; Wilhelm, Sascha</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16686</guid></item><item><title>How Do Acquisitions Affect the Mental Health of Employees?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16657</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Using employer-employee level data linked to individual health records, we document that the incidence of stress, anxiety, depression, psychiatric medication usage, and even suicide increase following acquisitions. These effects are prevalent among employees from both targets and acquirers, in weak as well as in growing, profitable firms. Employees who experience negative career developments within the merging firms, 'blue-collar' workers, and employees with lower cognitive and non-cognitive skills are most affected. A variety of tests address endogeneity concerns, including an analysis exploiting failed mergers. Our findings point to mental illness as a significant non-pecuniary cost of acquisitions.]]></description><author>Bach, Laurent &amp; Baghai, Ramin P. &amp; Bos, Marieke &amp; Silva, Rui C</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16657</guid></item><item><title>Intelligence Disclosure and Cooperation in Repeated Interactions</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16656</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We investigate in a laboratory setting whether revealing information on intelligence affects behavior in games with repeated interactions. In our experimental design we communicate information on the cognitive ability of both players. We use three stage games: Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) and two versions of Battle of Sexes (BoS), with high and low payoff inequality. We find that the information affects strategic behavior significantly in two distinct ways. 
In PD, disclosure markedly hampers cooperation, as higher intelligence players are less cooperative once they are made aware that they play against someone of lower ability than themselves in the disclosure treatment. Similarly, in BoS with low payoff inequality, disclosure disrupts coordination on outcomes with positive payoffs, as higher intelligence players try to force their most preferred outcome onto the less intelligent. 
However, in BoS with high payoff inequality, this pattern of behavior dramatically changes. Disclosure does not significantly affect coordination rates. Differently from the low payoff inequality game,  coordination is achieved more often on outcomes that favor less intelligent players. We conjecture that when coordination becomes more difficult, because of the high inequality between payoffs, intelligence and inequality together form a coordination device.]]></description><author>Lambrecht, Marco &amp; Proto, Eugenio &amp; Rustichini, Aldo &amp; Sofianos, Andis</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16656</guid></item><item><title>Selecting Valuation Distributions: Non-Price Decisions of Multi-Product Firms</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16655</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> This paper analyzes decisions of multi-product firms regarding product selection, innovation and advertising as choices of consumer valuation distributions. We show that a profit-maximizing monopolist chooses these distributions so as to maximize the dispersion of the valuation differences between goods across consumers. By contrast, she chooses the willingness-to-pay to be maximally or minimally dispersed, depending on the set of available distributions. In our benchmark model with uniform valuation differences, prices are increasing in valuation difference heterogeneity, but in more general settings this is not necessarily true. Moreover, the relation between willingness-to-pay heterogeneity and prices may well be non-monotone. Over wide parameter ranges, the firm's choice of valuation distribution does not maximize net consumer surplus. This problem is exacerbated when the firm has access to strategies that distort valuation heterogeneity or willingness-to-pay heterogeneity.]]></description><author>Bossard, Stefanie &amp; Schmutzler, Armin</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16655</guid></item><item><title>Relational Contracts and Trust in a High-Tech Industry</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16653</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We study how informal buyer-supplier relationships in the German automotive industry aï¬?ect procurement. Using unique data from a survey focusing on these, we show that more trust, the belief that the trading partner acts to maintain the mutual relationship, is associated with both higher quality of the automotive parts and more competition among suppliers. Yet both eï¬?ects hold only for parts involving unsophisticated technology, not when technology is sophisticated. We rationalize these ï¬?ndings within a relational contracting model that critically focuses on changes in the bargaining power, due to diï¬?erences in the costs of switching suppliers.]]></description><author>Calzolari, Giacomo &amp; Felli, Leonardo &amp; Koenen, Johannes &amp; Spagnolo, Giancarlo &amp; Stahl, Konrad O</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16653</guid></item><item><title>Circles of Trust: Rival Information in Social Networks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16597</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We analyze the diffusion of rival information in a social network. In our model, rational agents can share information sequentially, unconstrained by an exogenous protocol or timing. We show how to compute the set of eventually informed agents for any network, and show that it is essentially unique under altruistic preferences. The relationship between network structure and information diffusion is complex because the former shapes both the charity and confidentiality of potential senders and receivers.]]></description><author>Lee, Samuel &amp; Persson, Petra &amp; Roketskiy, Nikita</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16597</guid></item><item><title>Measuring corruption in the field using behavioral games</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16596</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Corruption is often harmful for economic development, yet it is difficult to measure due to its illicit nature. We propose a novel corruption game to characterize the interaction between actual political leaders and citizens, and implement it in Northern Mozambique. Contrary to the game-theoretic prediction, both leaders and citizens engage in corruption. Importantly, corruption in the game is correlated with real-world corruption by leaders: citizens send bribes to leaders whom we observe appropriating community money, and these leaders are likely to reciprocate the bribes. In corrupt behavior, we identify an important trust dimension captured by a standard trust game.]]></description><author>Armand, Alex &amp; Coutts, Alexander &amp; Vicente, Pedro C &amp; Vilela, Inês</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16596</guid></item><item><title>Do Peer Preferences Matter in School Choice Market Design? Theory and Evidence</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16544</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Can a clearinghouse generate a stable matching if it does not allow students to express their
preferences over both programs and peers? Theoretically, we show that a stable matching exists
with peer preferences under mild conditions, but finding one via canonical mechanisms is
unlikely. We show that increasing transparency about the previous cohort of students enrolling
at each program induces a tÃ¢tonnement wherein the distributions of former students play the
role of prices. We theoretically model this process and develop a test for match stability. We
implement this test empirically in the college admissions market in New South Wales (NSW),
Australia, where we find evidence for the existence of peer preferences. We show that the NSW
market fails to converge over time, and that this instability especially affects low socioeconomic
status students. To address these issues, we propose a new mechanism that improves upon the
current design, and we show that this mechanism generates a stable matching in the NSW
market.]]></description><author>Bachas, Natalie Marie &amp; Fonseca, Ricardo &amp; Pakzad-Hurson, Bobby</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16544</guid></item><item><title>Information Payoffs: An Interim Perspective</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16543</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We study the payoffs that can arise under some information structure from an interim perspective. There is a set of types distributed according to some prior distribution and a payoff function that assigns a value to each pair of a type and a belief over the types. Any information structure induces an interim payoff profile which describes, for each type, the expected payoff under the information structure conditional on the type. We characterize the set of all interim payoff profiles consistent with some information structure. We illustrate our results through applications.]]></description><author>Doval, Laura &amp; Smolin, Alex</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16543</guid></item><item><title>The Financial Channel of Wage Rigidity</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16499</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> I propose a financial channel of wage rigidity. In recessions, rather than propping up marginal (new hires') costs of labor, rigid average wages squeeze cash flows, forcing firms to cut hiring due to financial constraints. Indeed, empirical cash flows and profits would turn acyclical if wages were only moderately more procyclical. I study this channel in a search and matching model with financial constraints and rigid wages among incumbent workers, while new hires' wages are flexible. Individually, each feature generates no amplification. By contrast, their interaction can account for much of the empirical labor market fluctuations--breaking the neutrality of incumbents' wages for hiring, and showing that financial amplification of business cycles requires wage rigidity.]]></description><author>Schoefer, Benjamin</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16499</guid></item><item><title>Hyperspecialization and Hyperscaling: A Resource-based Theory of the Digital Firm</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16493</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Digital firms tend to be both narrow in their vertical scope and large in their scale. We explain this phenomenon through a theory about how attributes of firms' resource bundles impact their scale and specialization. We posit that highly scalable resource bundles entail significant opportunity costs of integration (versus outsourcing), which simultaneously drive "hyperspecialization" and "hyperscaling" in digital firms. Using descriptive theory and a formal model, we develop several propositions that align with observed features of digital businesses. We offer a parsimonious modeling framework for resource-based theorizing about highly scalable digital firms, shed light on the phenomenon of digital scaling, and provide insights into the far-reaching ways that technology-enabled resources are reshaping firms in the digital
economy.]]></description><author>Giustiziero, Gianluigi &amp; Kretschmer, Tobias &amp; Somaya, Deepak &amp; Wu, Brian</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16493</guid></item><item><title>Who Cares More?

We characterize optimal allocation rules when individual preferences are known and when they are not. Several insights emerge. First-best allocations may involve assigning some agents "lotteries" between high- and low-ranked goods. When preference intensities are private information, second-best allocations always involve such lotteries and, crucially, may coincide with first-best allocations. Furthermore, second-best allocations may entail disposal of services. We discuss a market-based alternative and show how it differs.]]></description><author>Ortoleva, Pietro &amp; Safonov, Evgenii &amp; Yariv, Leeat</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16491</guid></item><item><title>Networks and Manager Pay: Evidence from Time-Varying Exogenous Metrics</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16475</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> In this paper we assess the quantitative impact of a top manager's network on pay, using a
novel dataset that comprehends the entire career of top managers for the universe of business
firms in Portugal. We construct 5 different network metrics that are sensitive to exogenous
variation. Further, we analyze these metrics using high dimensional fixed effects models and
instrumental variable procedures to address thoroughly endogeneity concerns. We confirm that
networks are associated to higher manager pay, both base wage and bonus. A one standard
deviation increase in the number of connections is associated to a 8% higher bonus and 5%
higher total pay. The depth of the connections prevails over mere number, while indirect
measures capturing the information value of networks also matter. Finally, well connected
managers that have access to private information not only further their career options and
their bargaining power, they also benefit the firm. In other words, our results suggest that, from
the firm's perspective, productivity gains associated to large-network managers go beyond the
pay premium, so that networks are not overpaid.]]></description><author>Sazedj, Sharmin &amp; Tavares, José</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16475</guid></item><item><title>Information Markets and Nonmarkets</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16459</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> As large amounts of data become available and can be communicated more easily and processed more effectively, information has come to play a central role for economic activity and welfare in our age. This essay overviews contributions to the industrial organization of information markets and nonmarkets, while attempting to maintain a balance between foundational frameworks and more recent developments. We start by reviewing mechanism-design approaches to modeling the trade of information. We then cover ratings, predictions, and recommender systems. We turn to forecasting contests, prediction markets, and other institutions designed for collecting and aggregating information from decentralized participants. Finally, we discuss science as a prototypical information nonmarket with participants who interact in a non-anonymous way to produce and disseminate information. We aim to make the reader familiar with the central notions and insights in this burgeoning literature and also point to some open critical questions that future research will have to address.]]></description><author>Bergemann, Dirk &amp; Ottaviani, Marco</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16459</guid></item><item><title>Consumer Search and Choice Overload</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16440</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We consider a multiproduct seller facing consumers who must search to learn
prices and valuations. The equilibrium features choice overload: the larger
the product line, the fewer consumers start searching. We provide conditions
under which the seller offers too much or too little variety. We then allow
the seller to position products or make recommendations, thereby introducing
the possibility of directed search, and show that the seller may find it
profitable to maintain some noise. Finally, we study the seller's incentive
to disclose product identity and extend our analysis to that of a platform

The main purpose of this paper is to assess the effects of the concession in terms of passenger traffic. For that purpose, we applied a "difference-in-differences" econometric analysis of passenger traffic before and after the concession, using traffic data from the reports of the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority. As a control group, we used 24 regional airports that remained under state control. The econometric estimation provided indications that the change in the management model of these airports has contributed significantly to the increase of passenger traffic. In particular, the coefficient of the variable used to interpret the effect of privatisation on passenger traffic indicated that, controlling for heterogeneous trends and effects, passenger volume in the privatised airports was higher by 30% than it would have been under state control. The results indicate that strengthening the private sector involvement in the development and operation of public infrastructure may have positive economic impact, particularly when it involves the entry of an experienced international strategic investor in asset development in a country undergoing a prolonged and deep economic crisis.]]></description><author>Danchev, Svetoslav &amp; Paratsiokas, Nikos &amp; Vettas, Nikolaos</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16435</guid></item><item><title>Epidemics With Behavior</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16429</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We study social distancing in an epidemiological model. Distancing reduces the individual's probability of getting infected but comes at a cost. Equilibrium distancing flattens the curve and decreases the final size of the epidemic. We examine the effects of distancing on the outset, the peak, and the final size of the epidemic. Our results suggest that public policies that decrease the transmission rate can lead to unintended negative consequences in the short run but not in the long run. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the interventions that affect the transmission rate and the interventions that affect contact rates.]]></description><author>Carnehl, Christoph &amp; Fukuda, Satoshi &amp; Kos, Nenad</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16429</guid></item><item><title>The Political-Economic Causes of the Soviet Great Famine, 1932-33</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16408</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This study constructs a large new dataset to investigate whether state policy led to ethnic Ukrainians experiencing higher mortality during the 1932-33 Soviet Great Famine. All else equal, famine (excess) mortality rates were positively associated with ethnic Ukrainian population share across provinces, as well as across districts within provinces. Ukrainian ethnicity, rather than the administrative boundaries of the Ukrainian republic, mattered for famine mortality. These and many additional results provide strong evidence that higher Ukrainian famine mortality was an outcome of policy, and suggestive evidence on the political-economic drivers of repression.

A more precise match generates efficiency gains that the publisher can hope to exploit.  A coarser match will generate a thicker market and thus more competition.  The publisher can control the precision of the match by controlling the amount of information that advertisers have about viewers.  We characterize the optimal trade-off when impressions are sold by auction.  The publisher pools premium matches for advertisers (when there will be less competition on average) but gives advertisers full information about lower quality matches.]]></description><author>Bergemann, Dirk &amp; Heumann, Tibor &amp; Morris, Stephen</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16402</guid></item><item><title>Incentives, Self-Selection, and Coordination of Motivated Agents for the Production of Social Goods</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16400</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We study, theoretically and empirically, the effects of incentives on the self-selection and coordination of motivated agents to produce a social good. Agents join teams where they allocate effort to either generate individual monetary rewards (selfish effort) or contribute to the production of a social good with positive effort complementarities (social effort). Agents differ in their motivation to exert social effort. Our model predicts that lowering incentives for selfish effort in one team increases social good production by selectively attracting and coordinating motivated agents. We test this prediction in a lab experiment allowing us to cleanly separate the selection effect from other effects of low incentives. Results show that social good production more than doubles in the low- incentive team, but only if self-selection is possible. Our analysis highlights the important role of incentives in the matching of motivated agents engaged in social good production.]]></description><author>Bauer, Kevin &amp; Kosfeld, Michael &amp; Von Siemens, Ferdinand</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16400</guid></item><item><title>On the Dynamics of Technology Transfer</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16399</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We study the strategic timing and pace of cost reducing technology transfer by an upstream

may not fully compensate the upstream firm for the benefits that it has received, creates "hold-

the contractual relationship is crucially affected by the presence of competitors - in particular,
there is a delay in technology transfer, relative to the vertical integration benchmark. The
upstream firm is trying to limit the downstream firm's bargaining power, in an effort to pay
lower rent or no rent in the subsequent period. Price competition downstream does not fully
