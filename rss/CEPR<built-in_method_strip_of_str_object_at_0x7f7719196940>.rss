Decades ago, Williamson asserted that: (a) "substantially the same factors" (1973: 316) create governance issues not only within organizations but also in interactions between organizations; and (b) relational contracting might be useful in addressing these issues in both domains (1979, Figure II). More recently-in an informal conversation in 2002-he suggested a perspective on relational contracting that appears valuable in both of these domains: relational contracts as "deals that start when you sign them." The bulk of this essay explores past, present, and potential research on this perspective.]]></description><author>Robert Gibbons</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16803</guid></item></channel></rss>
