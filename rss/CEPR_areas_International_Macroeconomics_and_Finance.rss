The main novelty of this fiscal capacity is that it allows a joint response to these three types of shock within a single scheme, thus policymakers can decide on the stabilisation of one shock versus the others according to political and economic considerations. Our analysis, based on NUTS3 regional data over the last two decades, shows that - with a limited central budget and a low risk of moral hazard - substantial stabilisation could have been achieved in response to the eurozone and regional shocks, while country-specific shocks were less severe and therefore needed less stabilisation. Aggregating the transfers over the three levels, they are of the order of magnitude of the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility.]]></description><author>Josha Spronsen, Jacopo Cimadomo, Roel Beetsma</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16829</guid></item><item><title>Currency Wars, Trade Wars, and Global Demand</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16827</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Olivier Jeanne.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> This paper presents a tractable model of a global economy in which countries can use a broad range of policy instruments---the nominal interest rate, taxes on imports and exports, taxes on capital flows or foreign exchange interventions. Low demand may lead to unemployment because of downward nominal wage stickiness. Markov perfect equilibria with and without international cooperation are characterized in closed form. The welfare costs of trade and currency wars crucially depend on the state of global demand and on the policy instruments that are used by national policymakers. Countries have more incentives to deviate from free trade when global demand is low. Trade wars lower employment if they involve tariffs on imports but raise employment if they involve export subsidies. Tariff wars can lead to self-fulfilling global liquidity traps.]]></description><author>Olivier Jeanne</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16827</guid></item><item><title>Idiosyncratic Shocks and Aggregate Fluctuations in an Emerging Market</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16824</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Damiano Sandri, Emiliano Luttini, Francesco Grigoli.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> This paper provides the first assessment of the contribution of idiosyncratic shocks to aggregate fluctuations in an emerging market using confidential data on the universe of Chilean firms. We find that idiosyncratic shocks account for more than 40 percent of the volatility of aggregate sales. Although quite large, this contribution is smaller than documented in previous studies based on advanced economies, despite a higher degree of market concentration in Chile. We show that this finding is explained by larger firms being less volatile and by weaker propagation effects across Chilean firms.]]></description><author>Damiano Sandri, Emiliano Luttini, Francesco Grigoli</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16824</guid></item><item><title>Creative Destruction During Crises: An Opportunity for a Cleaner Energy Mix</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16819</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Nour Tawk, Jonathan D. Ostry, Davide Furceri, Pragyan Deb.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> Lockdowns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced overall energy demand but electricity generation from renewable sources has been resilient. While this partly reflects the trend increase in renewables, the empirical analysis presented in this paper highlights that recessions result in a permanent, albeit small, increase in energy efficiency and in the share of renewables in total electricity. These effects are stronger in the case of advanced economies and when complemented with environment and energy policies-both market-based measures such as taxes on pollutants, trading schemes and feed-in-tariffs, as well as non-market measures such as emission and fuel standards and R&D investment and subsidies-to incentivize and hasten the transition towards renewable sources of energy.]]></description><author>Nour Tawk, Jonathan D.

First, the shift from an "accounting based" view of debt sustainability, evaluated using government borrowing rates, to a "model based" view which uses stochastic discount rates. Second, empirical tests focusing on the relationship between primary balances to debt. Third, debt sustainability in the presence of rollover risk. And fourth, whether government borrowing costs below rates of growth ("r < g") generate a "free lunch" in the sense that debt sustainability does not require future primary surpluses. We argue that liquidity services provided by sovereign debt may indeed lead to a "free lunch", albeit of limited size. The value of such services depends on the credibility of the central bank, which can be accumulated via prudent policies and subsequently drawn on to allow for looser fiscal policy.]]></description><author>Jeromin Zettelmeyer, Tim Willems</author><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16817</guid></item><item><title>Superstar Returns</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16806</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Moritz Schularick, Martin Dohmen, Sebastian Kohl, Francisco Amaral.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> We study long-term returns on residential real estate in 27 "superstar" cities in 15 countries over 150 years. We find that total returns in superstar cities are close to 100 basis points lower per year than in the rest of the country. House prices tend to grow faster in the superstars, but rent returns are substantially greater outside the big agglomerations, resulting in higher long-run total returns. The excess returns outside the superstars can be rationalized as a compensation for risk, especially for higher co-variance with income growth and lower liquidity. Superstar real estate is comparatively safe.]]></description><author>Moritz Schularick, Martin Dohmen, Sebastian Kohl, Francisco Amaral</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16806</guid></item><item><title>The Impact of Rising Oil Prices on U.S. Inflation and Inflation Expectations in 2020-23</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16776</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Xiaoqing Zhou, Lutz Kilian.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> Predictions of oil prices reaching $100 per barrel during the winter of 2021/22 have raised fears of persistently high inflation and rising inflation expectations for years to come. We show that these concerns have been overstated. A $100 oil scenario of the type discussed by many observers, would only briefly raise monthly headline inflation, before fading rather quickly. However, the short-run effects on headline inflation would be sizable. For example, on a year-over-year basis, headline PCE inflation would increase by 1.8 percentage points at the end of 2021 under this scenario, and by 0.4 percentage points at the end of 2022. In contrast, the impact on measures of core inflation such as trimmed mean PCE inflation is only 0.4 and 0.3 percentage points in 2021 and 2022, respectively. These estimates already account for any increases in inflation expectations under the scenario. The peak response of the 1-year household inflation expectation would be 1.2 percentage points, while that of the 5-year expectation would be 0.2 percentage points.]]></description><author>Xiaoqing Zhou, Lutz Kilian</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16776</guid></item><item><title>What Has Been the Impact of COVID-19 on Debt? Turning a Wave into a Tsunami</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16775</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Naotaka Sugawara, Franziska Ohnsorge, Peter Nagle, M. Ayhan Kose.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on debt, puts recent debt developments and prospects in historical context, and analyzes new policy challenges associated with debt resolution. The paper reports three main results. First, even before the pandemic, a rapid buildup of debt in emerging market and developing economies-dubbed the "fourth wave" of debt-had been underway. Because of the sharp increase in debt during the pandemic-induced global recession of 2020, the fourth wave of debt has turned into a tsunami and become even more dangerous. Second, five years after past global recessions, global government debt continued to increase. In light of this historical record, and given large financing gaps and significant investment needs in many countries, debt levels will likely continue to rise in the near future. Third, debt resolution has become more complicated because of a highly fragmented creditor base, a lack of transparency in debt reporting, and a legacy stock of government debt without collective action clauses. National policy makers and the global community need to act rapidly and forcefully ensure that the fourth wave does not end with a string of debt crises in emerging market and developing economies as earlier debt waves did.]]></description><author>Naotaka Sugawara, Franziska Ohnsorge, Peter Nagle, M.

Yet, a substantial body of evidence is inconsistent with standard frictionless portfolio choice models. In this paper we introduce a quadratic cost of changes in portfolio allocation into a two-country DSGE model. We investigate the level of portfolio frictions most consistent with the data and the impact of portfolio frictions on asset prices and net capital flows. We find the portfolio friction accounts for (i) micro evidence of portfolio inertia by households, (ii) macro evidence of the price impact of financial shocks and related disconnect of asset prices from fundamentals, (iii) a broad set of moments related to the time series behavior of saving, investment and net capital flows, and (iv) other phenomena relating to excess return dynamics. Financial and saving shocks each account for close to half of the variance of net capital flows.]]></description><author>Eric van Wincoop, Margaret Davenport, Philippe Bacchetta</author><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16772</guid></item><item><title>Distributed Ledgers and the Governance of Money</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16752</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Cyril Monnet, Hyun Song Shin, Raphael Auer.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> Blockchain technology breathes new life into the classical analysis of money as a substitute for a ledger of all past transactions. While it involves updating the ledger through a decentralized consensus on the unique truth, the robustness of the equilibrium that supports this consensus depends on who has access to the ledger and how it can be updated. To find the optimal solution, Buterin's "scalability trilemma" needs to be addressed, so that a workable balance can be found between decentralization, security (i.e. a robust consensus), and scale (the efficient volume of transactions). Using a global game analysis of an exchange economy with credit, we solve for the optimal ledger design that balances the three objectives of this trilemma. We characterize the optimal number of validators, supermajority threshold, fees and transaction size. When intertemporal incentives are strong, a centralized ledger is always optimal. Otherwise, decentralization may be optimal, and validators need to be selected from the set of users of the system.]]></description><author>Cyril Monnet, Hyun Song Shin, Raphael Auer</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16752</guid></item><item><title>Sovereign Risk and Financial Risk</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16750</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Egon Zakrajšek, Vivian Yue, Bin Wei, Simon Gilchrist.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> In this paper, we study the interplay between sovereign risk and global financial risk. We show that a substantial portion of the comovement among sovereign spreads is accounted for by changes in global financial risk. We construct bond-level sovereign spreads for dollar-denominated bonds issued by over 50 countries from 1995 to 2020 and use various indicators to measure global financial risk. Through panel regressions and local projection analysis, we find that an increase in global financial risk causes a large and persistent widening of sovereign bond spreads. These effect are strongest when measuring global risk using the excess bond premium -- a measure of the risk-bearing
capacity of U.S. financial intermediaries. The spillover effects of global financial risk are more pronounced for speculative-grade sovereign bonds.]]></description><author>Egon Zakrajšek, Vivian Yue, Bin Wei, Simon Gilchrist</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16750</guid></item><item><title>What Types of Capital Flows Help Improve International Risk Sharing?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16749</link><description><![CDATA[<i>M. Ayhan Kose, Ergys Islamaj.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> Cross-border capital flows are expected to lead to increased international risk sharing by facilitating borrowing and lending in global financial markets. This paper examines risk-sharing outcomes of various types of capital flows (foreign direct investment, portfolio equity, debt, remittance, and aid flows) in a large sample of emerging market and developing economies. The results suggest that remittances and aid flows are associated with increased international risk sharing. Other types of capital flows are not consistently correlated with better risk-sharing outcomes. These findings are robust to the use of different econometric specifications, country-specific characteristics, and other controls.]]></description><author>M.

This paper explores how the cross-country impact of the pandemic relates to countries' dependence on these activities as a source of revenue. It first documents the size of the shock to net revenues from international travel and tourism for the balance of payments. For the median highly tourism-dependent economy the shock exceeded 10 percentage points of GDP, leading to a sizable current account deterioration. Indeed, empirical evidence suggests that current account adjustment in 2020 relative to pre-crisis forecasts was driven to an important extent by the collapse in revenues and expenditures on international travel as well as by the collapse in oil prices. On the economic growth front, the paper shows that the share of tourism activities in GDP is the single most important predictor of the growth shortfall in 2020 triggered by the COVID-19 crisis across the world as well as within the eurozone, even when compared to a variety of measures of the severity of the pandemic.]]></description><author>Gian Maria Milesi Ferretti</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16738</guid></item></channel></rss>
