We combine novel survey data on cultural preferences and economic outcomes of refugees with corresponding information on locals, and construct a threat index that integrates contemporaneous and historical variables. On average, refugees assimilate both culturally and economically. However, while refugees assigned to more hostile regions converge to local culture more quickly, they do not exhibit faster economic assimilation. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that refugees exert more assimilation effort in response to local threat, but fail to successfully integrate because of higher discrimination by locals in more hostile regions.]]></description><author>Marco Tabellini, Sulin Sardoschau, Philipp Jaschke</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16849</guid></item><item><title>The Politics of the Paycheck Protection Program</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16842</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Prachi Mishra, Thomas Lambert, Deniz Igan.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> This paper examines the incidence of special interests in the allocation of loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). We find that lobbying at the firm and industry levels helps obtain larger PPP loans during the pandemic. We also observe that PPP lending is more responsive to lobbying in ideologically less conservative areas as well as in industries less affected by the pandemic. Our findings are consistent with the notion that lobbying firms have experience in navigating administrative and policy complexity and can thus benefit more from aid provided under the PPP.]]></description><author>Prachi Mishra, Thomas Lambert, Deniz Igan</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16842</guid></item><item><title>Science as Civil Society:  Implications for a Green Transition</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16840</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Torsten Persson, Tim Besley.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> When scientists care about how they deploy their skills, this influences the relative cost of innovating in green sectors. We study the effects of motivated science in a simple model, where innovation is directed towards green or brown sectors with the latter polluting the environment. Innovation thus determines the relative growth rate for green goods. When we combine the resulting innovation dynamics with cultural dynamics among consumers, the influence of science is extended further. It can now increase the speed of convergence to a green future and may even change the direction of a society's path. Key activities that are (partly) value driven may thus be an important aspect of market economies.]]></description><author>Torsten Persson, Tim Besley</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16840</guid></item><item><title>Voice and Political Engagement: Evidence From a Natural Field Experiment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16839</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Andreas Stegmann, Christopher Roth, Lukas Hensel, Anselm Hager.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> We conduct a natural field experiment with a major European party to test whether giving

more opportunities to voice their opinions increases their engagement in the campaign as

In 1790, France's first Constituent Assembly overhauled the kingdom's organization to set up new administrative entities and local capitals. In a subset of departments, new capitals were chosen quasi-randomly as the Assembly abandoned its initial plan to rotate administrative functions across multiple cities. We study how exogenous changes in local administrative presence affect the state's coercive and productive capacity, as well as economic development in the ensuing decades. In the short run, proximity to the state increases taxation, conscription, and investments in law enforcement capacity. In the long run, the new local capitals and their periphery obtain more public goods and experience faster economic development. One hundred years after the reform, capitals are 40% more populated than comparable cities in 1790. Our results shed new light on the intertemporal and redistributive impacts of state-building in the context of one of the most ambitious administrative reforms ever implemented.]]></description><author>Benjamin Marx, Emeric Henry, Cédric Chambru</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16815</guid></item><item><title>Individual and Collective Information Acquisition: An Experimental Study</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16782</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Wing Suen, Jimmy Chan, Leeat Yariv, Alessandro Lizzeri, Pellumb Reshidi.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> Many committees---juries, political task forces, etc.---spend time gathering costly information before reaching a decision. We report results from lab experiments focused on such information-collection processes. We consider decisions governed by individuals and groups and compare how voting rules affect outcomes. We also contrast static information collection, as in classical hypothesis testing, with dynamic collection, as in sequential hypothesis testing. Several insights emerge. Static information collection is excessive, and sequential information collection is non-stationary, producing declining decision accuracies over time. Furthermore, groups using majority rule yield especially hasty and inaccurate decisions. Nonetheless, sequential information collection is welfare enhancing relative to static collection, particularly when unanimous rules are used.]]></description><author>Wing Suen, Jimmy Chan, Leeat Yariv, Alessandro Lizzeri, Pellumb Reshidi</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16782</guid></item><item><title>Money and Ideology: Evidence from Candidate Manifestos</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16774</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Elisa Mougin, Caroline Le Pennec, Julia Cagé.</i> <p> <b>December 12, 2021.</b> <p> Do campaign contributions influence politicians? In this article, we study the impact of corporate donations on ideology and political discourse. We construct a novel dataset that combines the campaign manifestos issued by every candidate running for a seat in the French parliament with data on the amount and origin of their campaign contributions. We exploit an exogenous historical shock on corporate donations to estimate their causal impact on the content of campaign communication. Combining a difference-in-differences approach with computational text analysis, we show that receiving more donations from corporate donors encourages candidates to advertise their local presence over national politics during the campaign. We also find evidence that donations lead candidates from extreme parties to moderate their rhetoric â?? including shifts in the policy topics they advertise. Our findings may reflect a "quid-pro-quo effect" between donors and politicians, but they may also result from an "electoral effect": receiving expressive contributions from corporate donors affects the content of campaign messages because it changes candidates' perception of which issues matter most to voters. According to our findings, campaign finance regulations may alter the information made available to voters through their impact on candidates' rhetoric.]]></description><author>Elisa Mougin, Caroline Le Pennec, Julia Cagé</author><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16774</guid></item><item><title>Production Networks and War</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16759</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Alexey Makarin, Vasily Korovkin.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> How do severe shocks such as war alter the economy? We study how a country's production network is affected by a devastating but localized conflict. Using unique transaction-level data on Ukrainian railway shipments, we uncover several novel indirect effects of conflict on firms. First, we document substantial propagation effects on interfirm trade---trade declines even between partners outside the conflict areas if one of them had traded with those areas before the start of the war. The magnitude of such second-degree effect of conflict is one-third of the first-degree effect. Ignoring this propagation would lead to an underestimate of the total impact of conflict on trade by about 67%. Second, war induces sudden changes in the production-network structure that influence firm performance. Specifically, we find that firms that exogenously became more central---after the conflict practically cut off certain regions from the rest of Ukraine---received a relative boost to their revenues and profits. Finally, in a production-network model, we separately estimate the effects of the exogenous firm removal and the subsequent endogenous network adjustment on firm revenue distribution. At the median, network adjustment compensates for 80% of the network-destruction effect a year after the conflict onset.]]></description><author>Alexey Makarin, Vasily Korovkin</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16759</guid></item><item><title>Covid-19 and the Forces Behind Social Unrest</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16756</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Mario Lackner, Uwe Sunde, Rudolf Winter-Ebmer.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> The unprecedented consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic have raised concerns about intensified social unrest, but evidence for such a link and the underlying channels is still lacking. We use a unique combination of nationally representative survey data, event data on social unrest, and data on Covid-19 fatalities and unemployment at a weekly resolution to investigate the forces behind social unrest in the context of the strains on public health and the economy due to the pandemic in the USA. The results show that pandemic-related unemployment and Covid-19 fatalities intensified negative emotional stress and led to a deterioration of economic confidence among individuals. The prevalence of negative emotional stress, particularly in economically strained and politically polarized environments, was, in turn, associated with intensified social unrest as measured by political protests. No such link is found for economic perceptions.]]></description><author>Mario Lackner, Uwe Sunde, Rudolf Winter-Ebmer</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16756</guid></item><item><title>The impact of 2020 French municipal elections on the spread of COVID-19</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16746</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Marc Sangnier, Guilhem Cassan.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> In the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government decided to maintain the first round of the 2020 municipal elections that was scheduled on March 15, 2020. What has been the impact of these elections on the spread of COVID-19 in France? Answering this question leads to intricate econometric issues as omitted variables may drive both epidemiological dynamics and electoral turnout, and as a national lockdown was imposed almost at the same time as the elections. In order to disentangle the effect of the elections from that of confounding factors, we first predict each dÃ©partement's own epidemiological dynamics using information up to the election to calibrate a standard logistic model. We then take advantage of differences in electoral turnout across dÃ©partements to identify the impact of the election on prediction errors in hospitalizations. We report a detrimental effect of the first round of the election in locations that were at relatively advanced stages of the epidemic by the time of the election. Estimates suggest that elections accounted for at least 3,000 hospitalization,
that is 11% of all hospitalizations by the end of March. This indicates that the health cost of holding elections during an epidemic is important and that promoting ways of voting that lower exposure to contamination is key until the COVID-19 pandemic shows signs of abating.]]></description><author>Marc Sangnier, Guilhem Cassan</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16746</guid></item><item><title>A Primer on Trade and Inequality</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16742</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Dani Rodrik.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> In the public imagination globalization's adverse effects have loomed large, contributing significantly to the backlash against the political mainstream and the rise of far-right populism. The literature on trade and inequality is in fact exceptionally rich, with important theoretical insights as well as extensive empirical findings that sheds light on this recent experience. Some of the key results of this literature, discussed here, are as follows: Redistribution is the flip side of the gains from trade, and it becomes larger relative to net gains from trade in the advanced stages of globalization. Compensation is difficult for both economic and political reasons. International trade often differs from other market exchanges, raising fairness concerns in ways that domestic markets do not. The economic benefits of deep integration are generally ambiguous. Dynamic or growth gains from trade are uncertain.]]></description><author>Dani Rodrik</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16742</guid></item><item><title>The Gender Gap in Preferences: Evidence from 45,397 Facebook Interests</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16740</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Ignacio Ortuño-Ortín, Klaus Desmet, Ruben Cuevas, Ángel Cuevas.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> This paper uses information on the frequency of 45,397 Facebook interests to study how the difference in preferences between men and women changes with a country's degree of gender equality.

Using a shift-share identification strategy, we show how millions of Southern white migrants transformed the cultural and political landscape across America. Counties with a larger Southern white share by 1940 exhibited growing support for right-wing politics throughout the 20th century and beyond. Racial animus, religious conservatism, and localist attitudes among the Southern white diaspora hastened partisan realignment as the Republican Party found fresh support for the Southern strategy outside the South. Their congressional representatives were more likely to oppose politically liberal legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and to object to the Electoral College count in 2021. These migrants helped shape institutions that reinforced racial inequity and exclusion, they shared ideology through religious organizations and popular media, and they transmitted an array of cultural norms to non-Southern populations. Together, our findings suggest that Southern white migrants may have forever changed the trajectory of American politics.]]></description><author>Patrick Testa, Thomas Pearson, Martin Fiszbein, Andreas Ferrara, Samuel Bazzi</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16739</guid></item><item><title>Short-term political memory and the inevitability of polarisation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16737</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Gilat Levy, Ronny Razin.</i> <p> <b>November 11, 2021.</b> <p> In this paper we explore the effect of short memories on political outcomes in a model in which politics is viewed as a collective learning process . We analyse a dynamic model in which voters use past observations to learn about the optimal policy and political parties are self-interested, with polarised ideal policies. Voters balance party loyalty with a desire to vote for the party whose policy is based on a better interpretation of past observations. We show that short-term memory leads to political cycles of polarisation and convergence. Historical periods of convergence lead parties to polarise, whereas periods of polarisation imply convergence of platforms. Our framework also allows us to model the strategic use of biased histories and narratives in political competition, such as the use of nostalgia.]]></description><author>Gilat Levy, Ronny Razin</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16737</guid></item></channel></rss>
