Theory and Evidence</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16544</link><description>Can a clearinghouse generate a stable matching if it does not allow students to express their
preferences over both programs and peers? Theoretically, we show that a stable matching exists
with peer preferences under mild conditions, but finding one via canonical mechanisms is
unlikely. We show that increasing transparency about the previous cohort of students enrolling
at each program induces a tÃ¢tonnement wherein the distributions of former students play the
role of prices. We theoretically model this process and develop a test for match stability. We
implement this test empirically in the college admissions market in New South Wales (NSW),
Australia, where we find evidence for the existence of peer preferences. We show that the NSW
market fails to converge over time, and that this instability especially affects low socioeconomic
status students. To address these issues, we propose a new mechanism that improves upon the
current design, and we show that this mechanism generates a stable matching in the NSW
market.</description><author>Bachas, Natalie Marie &amp; Fonseca, Ricardo &amp; Pakzad-Hurson, Bobby</author></item><item><title>Information Payoffs: An Interim Perspective</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16543</link><description>We study the payoffs that can arise under some information structure from an interim perspective. There is a set of types distributed according to some prior distribution and a payoff function that assigns a value to each pair of a type and a belief over the types. Any information structure induces an interim payoff profile which describes, for each type, the expected payoff under the information structure conditional on the type. We characterize the set of all interim payoff profiles consistent with some information structure. We illustrate our results through applications.</description><author>Doval, Laura &amp; Smolin, Alex</author></item><item><title>The Financial Channel of Wage Rigidity</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16499</link><description>I propose a financial channel of wage rigidity. In recessions, rather than propping up marginal (new hires') costs of labor, rigid average wages squeeze cash flows, forcing firms to cut hiring due to financial constraints. Indeed, empirical cash flows and profits would turn acyclical if wages were only moderately more procyclical. I study this channel in a search and matching model with financial constraints and rigid wages among incumbent workers, while new hires' wages are flexible. Individually, each feature generates no amplification. By contrast, their interaction can account for much of the empirical labor market fluctuations--breaking the neutrality of incumbents' wages for hiring, and showing that financial amplification of business cycles requires wage rigidity.</description><author>Schoefer, Benjamin</author></item><item><title>Hyperspecialization and Hyperscaling: A Resource-based Theory of the Digital Firm</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16493</link><description>Digital firms tend to be both narrow in their vertical scope and large in their scale. We explain this phenomenon through a theory about how attributes of firms' resource bundles impact their scale and specialization. We posit that highly scalable resource bundles entail significant opportunity costs of integration (versus outsourcing), which simultaneously drive "hyperspecialization" and "hyperscaling" in digital firms. Using descriptive theory and a formal model, we develop several propositions that align with observed features of digital businesses. We offer a parsimonious modeling framework for resource-based theorizing about highly scalable digital firms, shed light on the phenomenon of digital scaling, and provide insights into the far-reaching ways that technology-enabled resources are reshaping firms in the digital
economy.</description><author>Giustiziero, Gianluigi &amp; Kretschmer, Tobias &amp; Somaya, Deepak &amp; Wu, Brian</author></item><item><title>Who Cares More? Allocation with Diverse Preference Intensities</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16491</link><description>Goods and services---public housing, medical appointments, schools---are often allocated to individuals who rank them similarly but differ in their preference intensities. We characterize optimal allocation rules when individual preferences are known and when they are not. Several insights emerge. First-best allocations may involve assigning some agents "lotteries" between high- and low-ranked goods. When preference intensities are private information, second-best allocations always involve such lotteries and, crucially, may coincide with first-best allocations. Furthermore, second-best allocations may entail disposal of services. We discuss a market-based alternative and show how it differs.</description><author>Ortoleva, Pietro &amp; Safonov, Evgenii &amp; Yariv, Leeat</author></item><item><title>Networks and Manager Pay: Evidence from Time-Varying Exogenous Metrics</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16475</link><description>In this paper we assess the quantitative impact of a top manager's network on pay, using a
novel dataset that comprehends the entire career of top managers for the universe of business
firms in Portugal. We construct 5 different network metrics that are sensitive to exogenous
variation. Further, we analyze these metrics using high dimensional fixed effects models and
instrumental variable procedures to address thoroughly endogeneity concerns. We confirm that
networks are associated to higher manager pay, both base wage and bonus. A one standard
deviation increase in the number of connections is associated to a 8% higher bonus and 5%
higher total pay. The depth of the connections prevails over mere number, while indirect
measures capturing the information value of networks also matter. Finally, well connected
managers that have access to private information not only further their career options and
their bargaining power, they also benefit the firm. In other words, our results suggest that, from
the firm's perspective, productivity gains associated to large-network managers go beyond the
pay premium, so that networks are not overpaid.</description><author>Sazedj, Sharmin &amp; Tavares, José</author></item><item><title>Information Markets and Nonmarkets</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16459</link><description>As large amounts of data become available and can be communicated more easily and processed more effectively, information has come to play a central role for economic activity and welfare in our age. This essay overviews contributions to the industrial organization of information markets and nonmarkets, while attempting to maintain a balance between foundational frameworks and more recent developments. We start by reviewing mechanism-design approaches to modeling the trade of information. We then cover ratings, predictions, and recommender systems. We turn to forecasting contests, prediction markets, and other institutions designed for collecting and aggregating information from decentralized participants. Finally, we discuss science as a prototypical information nonmarket with participants who interact in a non-anonymous way to produce and disseminate information. We aim to make the reader familiar with the central notions and insights in this burgeoning literature and also point to some open critical questions that future research will have to address.</description><author>Bergemann, Dirk &amp; Ottaviani, Marco</author></item><item><title>Consumer Search and Choice Overload</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16440</link><description>We consider a multiproduct seller facing consumers who must search to learn
prices and valuations. The equilibrium features choice overload: the larger
the product line, the fewer consumers start searching. We provide conditions
under which the seller offers too much or too little variety. We then allow
the seller to position products or make recommendations, thereby introducing
the possibility of directed search, and show that the seller may find it
profitable to maintain some noise. Finally, we study the seller's incentive
to disclose product identity and extend our analysis to that of a platform
choosing which sellers to host.</description><author>Nocke, Volker &amp; Rey, Patrick</author></item><item><title>The impact of the concession of 14 regional Greek airports on passenger traffic</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16435</link><description>Greece implemented an extensive privatization program in the past decade, which included the concession of 14 regional airports for a period of 40 years. The main purpose of this paper is to assess the effects of the concession in terms of passenger traffic. For that purpose, we applied a "difference-in-differences" econometric analysis of passenger traffic before and after the concession, using traffic data from the reports of the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority. As a control group, we used 24 regional airports that remained under state control. The econometric estimation provided indications that the change in the management model of these airports has contributed significantly to the increase of passenger traffic. In particular, the coefficient of the variable used to interpret the effect of privatisation on passenger traffic indicated that, controlling for heterogeneous trends and effects, passenger volume in the privatised airports was higher by 30% than it would have been under state control. The results indicate that strengthening the private sector involvement in the development and operation of public infrastructure may have positive economic impact, particularly when it involves the entry of an experienced international strategic investor in asset development in a country undergoing a prolonged and deep economic crisis.</description><author>Danchev, Svetoslav &amp; Paratsiokas, Nikos &amp; Vettas, Nikolaos</author></item><item><title>Epidemics With Behavior</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16429</link><description>We study social distancing in an epidemiological model. Distancing reduces the individual's probability of getting infected but comes at a cost. Equilibrium distancing flattens the curve and decreases the final size of the epidemic. We examine the effects of distancing on the outset, the peak, and the final size of the epidemic. Our results suggest that public policies that decrease the transmission rate can lead to unintended negative consequences in the short run but not in the long run. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the interventions that affect the transmission rate and the interventions that affect contact rates.</description><author>Carnehl, Christoph &amp; Fukuda, Satoshi &amp; Kos, Nenad</author></item><item><title>The Political-Economic Causes of the Soviet Great Famine, 1932-33</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16408</link><description>This study constructs a large new dataset to investigate whether state policy led to ethnic Ukrainians experiencing higher mortality during the 1932-33 Soviet Great Famine. All else equal, famine (excess) mortality rates were positively associated with ethnic Ukrainian population share across provinces, as well as across districts within provinces. Ukrainian ethnicity, rather than the administrative boundaries of the Ukrainian republic, mattered for famine mortality. These and many additional results provide strong evidence that higher Ukrainian famine mortality was an outcome of policy, and suggestive evidence on the political-economic drivers of repression. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that bias against Ukrainians explains up to 77% of famine deaths in the three republics of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and up to 92% in Ukraine.</description><author>Markevich, Andrei &amp; Naumenko, Natalya &amp; Qian, Nancy</author></item><item><title>Selling Impressions: Efficiency vs. Competition</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16402</link><description>In digital advertising, a publisher selling impressions faces a trade-off in deciding how precisely to match advertisers with viewers.  A more precise match generates efficiency gains that the publisher can hope to exploit.  A coarser match will generate a thicker market and thus more competition.  The publisher can control the precision of the match by controlling the amount of information that advertisers have about viewers.  We characterize the optimal trade-off when impressions are sold by auction.  The publisher pools premium matches for advertisers (when there will be less competition on average) but gives advertisers full information about lower quality matches.</description><author>Bergemann, Dirk &amp; Heumann, Tibor &amp; Morris, Stephen</author></item><item><title>Incentives, Self-Selection, and Coordination of Motivated Agents for the Production of Social Goods</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16400</link><description>We study, theoretically and empirically, the effects of incentives on the self-selection and coordination of motivated agents to produce a social good. Agents join teams where they allocate effort to either generate individual monetary rewards (selfish effort) or contribute to the production of a social good with positive effort complementarities (social effort). Agents differ in their motivation to exert social effort. Our model predicts that lowering incentives for selfish effort in one team increases social good production by selectively attracting and coordinating motivated agents. We test this prediction in a lab experiment allowing us to cleanly separate the selection effect from other effects of low incentives. Results show that social good production more than doubles in the low- incentive team, but only if self-selection is possible. Our analysis highlights the important role of incentives in the matching of motivated agents engaged in social good production.</description><author>Bauer, Kevin &amp; Kosfeld, Michael &amp; Von Siemens, Ferdinand</author></item><item><title>On the Dynamics of Technology Transfer</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16399</link><description>We study the strategic timing and pace of cost reducing technology transfer by an upstream
monopolist to a downstream market when there is potential competition downstream and the
protection of intellectual property rights is imperfect. The possibility that the downstream firm
may not fully compensate the upstream firm for the benefits that it has received, creates "hold-
up" issues. In equilibrium transfer occurs to the same downstream firm in both periods, however
the contractual relationship is crucially affected by the presence of competitors - in particular,
there is a delay in technology transfer, relative to the vertical integration benchmark. The
upstream firm is trying to limit the downstream firm's bargaining power, in an effort to pay
lower rent or no rent in the subsequent period. Price competition downstream does not fully
eliminate the opportunistic behavior created by the imperfect intellectual property rights.</description><author>Kourandi, Frago &amp; Sachtachtinskagia, Sabina &amp; Vettas, Nikolaos</author></item><item><title>The Gender Pay Gap: Micro Sources and Macro Consequences</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16383</link><description>We document that a large share of the gender pay gap in Brazil is due to women working at lower-paying employers. However, compared with that of men, women's revealed-preference ranking of employers is less increasing in pay. To interpret these facts, we develop an empirical equilibrium search model with endogenous gender differences in pay, amenities, and recruiting intensities across employers. The estimated model suggests that compensating differentials explain one-fifth of the gender pay gap, that there are significant output and welfare gains from eliminating gender differences, and that equal-treatment policies fail to close the gender pay gap.</description><author>Morchio, Iacopo &amp; Moser, Christian</author></item><item><title>Meaning in Communication Games</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16374</link><description>This paper addresses two related questions: How can we capture different degrees of sharing a language with pre-specified meanings?
