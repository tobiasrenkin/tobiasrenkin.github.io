economics around the globe (including universities, business schools and other organizations
such as central banks), we document the underrepresentation of women
in economics. For the 238 universities and business schools in the sample, women
hold 25% of senior level positions (full professor, associate professor) and 37% of
junior level positions. In the 82 U.S. universities and business schools, the figures
are 20% on the senior level and 32% on the entry level, while in the 122 European
institutions, the numbers are 27% and 38%, respectively, with some heterogeneity
across countries. The numbers also show that the highest-ranking institutions (in
terms of research output) have fewer women in senior positions. Moreover, in the
U.S., this effect is even present on the junior level. The "leaky pipeline" may hence
begin earlier than oftentimes assumed, and is even more of an issue in the highly
integrated market of the U.S. In Europe, an institution ranked 100 places higher
has three percentage points fewer women in senior positions, but in the U.S. it is
almost 5 percentage points.]]></description><author>Auriol, Emmanuelle &amp; Friebel, Guido &amp; Weinberger, Alisa &amp; Wilhelm, Sascha</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16686</guid></item><item><title>Misdiagnosing Bank Capital Problems</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16680</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Bulow, Jeremy & Klemperer, Paul.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Banks' reluctance to repair their balance sheets, combined with deposit insurance and regulatory forbearance in recognizing greater risks and losses, can lead to solvency problems that look like liquidity (bank-run) crises. Regulatory forbearance incentivizes banks to both retain risky loans and reject new good opportunities. With sufficient regulatory forbearance, partially-insured banks act exactly as if they are fully insured. Stress tests certify that uninsured creditors will be paid, not that banks are solvent, and have ambiguous effects on the efficiency of investment.]]></description><author>Bulow, Jeremy &amp; Klemperer, Paul</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16680</guid></item><item><title>Competition and Misconduct</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16678</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Thanassoulis, John.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Misconduct is widespread; practices such as mis-selling, pump&dump, and money laundering harm counterparties while raising profits. This paper presents a mechanism which can determine what sorts of misconduct can be sustained in competitive equilibrium in concentrated markets, oligopoly settings, and in markets with many small competing firms. The model studied allows general demand and makes a distinction in types of ethical dilemma using current psychological understanding. The paper shows, for example, that markets with many small competing firms are not vulnerable to misconduct if firms respond to entry with niche strategies or if the ethical dilemma draws an emotional response.]]></description><author>Thanassoulis, John</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16678</guid></item><item><title>An Empirical Model of Quantity Discounts with Large Choice Sets</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16666</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Iaria, Alessandro & WANG, Ao.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We introduce a Generalized Nested Logit model of demand for bundles that can be estimated sequentially and virtually eliminates any challenge of dimensionality related to large choice sets. We use it to investigate quantity discounts for carbonated soft drinks by simulating a counterfactual with linear pricing. The prices of quantities up to 1L decrease by -31.5% while those of larger quantities increase by +14.8%. Purchased quantities decrease by -20.4%, associated added sugar by -23.8%, and industry profit by -20.5%.

We show that a profit-maximizing monopolist chooses these distributions so as to maximize the dispersion of the valuation differences between goods across consumers. By contrast, she chooses the willingness-to-pay to be maximally or minimally dispersed, depending on the set of available distributions. In our benchmark model with uniform valuation differences, prices are increasing in valuation difference heterogeneity, but in more general settings this is not necessarily true. Moreover, the relation between willingness-to-pay heterogeneity and prices may well be non-monotone. Over wide parameter ranges, the firm's choice of valuation distribution does not maximize net consumer surplus. This problem is exacerbated when the firm has access to strategies that distort valuation heterogeneity or willingness-to-pay heterogeneity.]]></description><author>Bossard, Stefanie &amp; Schmutzler, Armin</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16655</guid></item><item><title>Relational Contracts and Trust in a High-Tech Industry</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16653</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Calzolari, Giacomo & Felli, Leonardo & Koenen, Johannes & Spagnolo, Giancarlo & Stahl, Konrad O.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We study how informal buyer-supplier relationships in the German automotive industry aï¬?ect procurement.

The statistic is based on the insight that at the optimal housing price, the consumption gains
induced by higher housing prices offset the welfare costs of a reduction in housing uses and household leisure. To apply the methodology, we use Italian data over the 1993-2006 period. As a source of exogenous variation for housing prices we rely on a share-shift
instrument exploiting the facts that (i) owing to seminal historical and cultural episodes, foreign nationals have preferences for buying houses in different Italian provinces and (ii) shifts in a country's foreign investment are largely exogenous to the economic performance
of specific Italian provinces. The data indicate that higher housing prices increase local consumption more than they decrease leisure and housing use by locals, suggesting that housing prices were inefficiently low.]]></description><author>Michelacci, Claudio &amp; Pozzi, Andrea</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16648</guid></item><item><title>Identifying State Dependence in Brand Choice: Evidence from Hurricanes</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16632</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Levine, Julia & Seiler, Stephan.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We analyze structural state dependence in brand choice using variation from brand switching during stock-outs caused by hurricanes. We derive a simple test for structural state dependence based on the time-series of choice persistence for households affected by the stock-outs that requires fewer assumptions than most previous work. Using data from the bottled water category, we show that demand increases substantially around hurricane events and causes households to purchase different brands. We find that purchase behavior reverts back to its pre-hurricane trajectory immediately after the hurricane and we are not able to reject the null hypothesis of no structural state dependence. We show that our results are not driven by unusual purchases during the hurricane or context-specific purchase behavior.]]></description><author>Levine, Julia &amp; Seiler, Stephan</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16632</guid></item><item><title>Revisiting the Anticompetitive Effects of Common Ownership</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16612</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Azar, José & Vives, Xavier.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We use data from the U.S. airline industry to test the hypothesis, consistent with the general equilibrium oligopoly model of Azar and Vives (2021), that inter-industry common ownership should be associated with lower prices in product markets. We find that, as the model predicts, increases over time in intra-industry common ownership are associated with higher prices, while increases in inter-industry common ownership are associated with lower prices. The aggregate effect is nil. We also find that common ownership by the "Big Three" (BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street) is associated with lower airline prices, while common ownership by shareholders other than the Big Three is associated with higher prices. The results highlight the limitations of partial equilibrium oligopoly theory in the context of common ownership, and the need to consider a general equilibrium perspective.]]></description><author>Azar, José &amp; Vives, Xavier</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16612</guid></item><item><title>Comparing European healthcare systems</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16602</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Boone, Jan.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the effects on health system performance of health policy choices related to efficiency, quality and competition and use recent data from Eurostat and OECD to verify the predictions. We find that --conditional on healthcare expenditure-- the following efficiency measures lead to improved performance in terms of reduced mortality:  increasing the ratio of nurses over doctors and a well developed primary care sector. Introducing a regulator specifically for healthcare quality and making provider quality reports public are associated with improved outcomes. In terms of competition, allowing patients to choose their provider leads to lower mortality. But in terms of insurer competition, single payer systems tend to do better than multiple insurers, especially in countries where inpatient care is predominantly delivered by public hospitals.]]></description><author>Boone, Jan</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16602</guid></item><item><title>How Do Markets Clear Without Price Adjustments?

Using comprehensive data collected twice a week over three years from 180 Israeli localities, we first show that  online grocers set identical prices in all markets where they operate. In contrast, service times are shorter in more competitive markets, on low-demand/low-cost days of the week, and for deliveries offered by high-priced grocers. Next, we exploit regional and temporal variation in entry decisions to examine how incumbents respond. We find that incumbents reduce service time when facing entry, but only on low-demand/low-utilization days. This reduction begins shortly before entry and is greater in monopolistic markets and when entrants pose a larger threat to the incumbent. Service time falls also in markets that do not experience entry yet are served by a fulfillment center serving markets facing entry. We use the classic newsvendor problem model to explain our findings, and in doing so emphasize the importance of accounting for both competitive and supply-side considerations when analyzing firms' response, particularly when prices are unresponsive.]]></description><author>Ater, Itai &amp; Shany, Adi</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16601</guid></item><item><title>The Rise of Scientific Research in Corporate America</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16592</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Arora, Ashish & Belenzon, Sharon & Kosenko, Konstantin & Suh, Jungkyu & Yafeh, Yishay.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Corporate science in America emerged in the interwar period, as some companies set up state-of-the-art corporate laboratories, hired highly skilled scientists, and embarked upon basic research of the kind we would associate today with academic institutions. Using a newly assembled dataset on U.S. companies between 1926 and 1940 combining information on corporate ownership, organization, research and innovation, we attempt to explain the rise of corporate research. We argue that it was driven by companies trying to take advantage of opportunities for innovation made possible by scientific advances and an underdeveloped academic research system in the United States. Measuring field-specific scientific backwardness in several different ways, we find that large firms, business group-affiliated firms, and firms close to the technological frontier were more likely to initiate scientific research. We also find that companies in monopolistic or concentrated industries were more likely to engage in basic research. Corporate research was positively correlated with novel and valuable patents, and with market-to-book ratios. For companies choosing to do so, investment in corporate research seems to have paid off. The results shed light on the link between corporate organization, market structure and corporate science.]]></description><author>Arora, Ashish &amp; Belenzon, Sharon &amp; Kosenko, Konstantin &amp; Suh, Jungkyu &amp; Yafeh, Yishay</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16592</guid></item><item><title>Consumer Search and Prices in the Automobile Market</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16574</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Moraga-González, José-Luis & Sándor, Zsolt & Wildenbeest, Matthijs.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> This paper develops a discrete choice model of demand with optimal sequential consumer search. Consumers first choose a product to search; then, once they learn the utility they get from the searched product, they choose whether to buy it or to keep searching. We characterize the search problem as a standard discrete choice problem and propose a parametric search cost distribution that generates closed-form expressions for the probability of purchasing a product. We propose a method to estimate the model that supplements aggregate product data with individual-specific data which allows for the separate identification of search costs and preferences. We estimate the model using data from the automobile industry and find that search costs have non-trivial implications for elasticities and markups. We study the effects of exclusive dealing regulation and find that firms benefit at the expense of consumers, who face higher search costs and higher prices than would be the case if multi-brand dealerships were used.]]></description><author>Moraga-González, José-Luis &amp; Sándor, Zsolt &amp; Wildenbeest, Matthijs</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16574</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic Strategic Corporate Finance: A Tug of War with Financial Frictions</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16567</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Doraszelski, Ulrich & Gomes, Joao F & Nockher, Felix.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Access to capital markets plays a key role for the evolution of an industry over time.

Shareholder maximizers commit to a mission statement that extends beyond firm value maximiza- tion. This commitment leads firms (either product market competitors or complementors along the value chain) to change their actions in ways that ultimately favor shareholders. We thus provide a formal analysis of the "doing well by doing good" adage. We also pro- vide conditions such that the mission statement game has the nature of a pure coordination game.

We measure the causal impact of the regulation on EEA roaming traffic, using the Rest of the World as a control group. We find large and heterogeneous effects on retail and wholesale traffic volumes and revenues. To evaluate the welfare effects of the regulation, we develop a framework that includes consumer surplus, retail and wholesale profits. The gains in consumer surplus are large, and mainly stem from data services. The consumer gains are proportionately larger in small, open economies and in countries with previously high roaming prices. Finally, total welfare increases considerably, because the consumer surplus gains far outweigh profit losses. As such, the removal of market power more than compensates for a distortion from a possible overconsumption at zero surcharges.]]></description><author>Canzian, Giulia &amp; Mazzararella, Gianluca &amp; Ranchail, Louis &amp; Verboven, Frank &amp; Verzillo, Stefano</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16554</guid></item><item><title>The Competitive Effects of Vertical Integration in Platform Markets</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16545</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Pouyet, Jérôme & Thomas, Trégouët.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> We analyze vertical integration between platforms providing operating systems to manufacturers of devices in presence of indirect network effects between buyers of devices and developers of applications.

I argue that if AI continues to be deployed along its current trajectory and remains unregulated, it may produce various social, economic and political harms. These include: damaging competition, consumer privacy and consumer choice; excessively automating work, fueling inequality, inefficiently pushing down wages, and failing to improve worker productivity; and damaging political discourse, democracy's most fundamental lifeblood. Although there is no conclusive evidence suggesting that these costs are imminent or substantial, it may be useful to understand them before they are fully realized and become harder or even impossible to reverse, precisely because of AI's promising and wide-reaching potential. I also suggest that these costs are not inherent to the nature of AI technologies, but are related to how they are being used and developed at the moment - to empower corporations and governments against workers and citizens. As a result, efforts to limit and reverse these costs may need to rely on regulation and policies to redirect AI research. Attempts to contain them
just by promoting competition may be insufficient.]]></description><author>Acemoglu, Daron</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16524</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic Games in Empirical Industrial Organization</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16514</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Aguirregabiria, Victor & Collard-Wexler, Allan & Ryan, Stephen.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> This survey is organized around three main topics: models, econometrics, and empirical applications.

We also discuss extensions of the basic framework, including models in continuous time, the concepts of oblivious equilibrium and experience-based equilibrium, and dynamic games where firms have non-equilibrium beliefs. In section 3, we first provide an overview of the types of data used in this literature, before turning to a discussion of identification issues and results, and estimation methods. We review different methods to deal with multiple equilibria and large state spaces. We also describe recent developments for estimating games in continuous time and incorporating serially correlated unobservables, and discuss the use of machine learning methods to solving and estimating dynamic games. Section 4 discusses empirical applications of dynamic games in IO. We start describing the first empirical applications in this literature during the early 2000s.

A more precise match generates efficiency gains that the publisher can hope to exploit.  A coarser match will generate a thicker market and thus more competition.
