Disenchanted citizens therefore prefer committed delegates  to  politicians who propose themselves as competent policy makers but without a specific policy commitment (trustees). In a two-party competition, the unique asymmetric equilibrium is such that voters with lower interest for the common good select a committed delegate, while those with higher interest for the common good appoint a trustee. In this equilibrium, we show that the committed delegate also  chooses all the strategies typically associated with populism in the literature. Hence, this paper puts forward a commitment theory of populism.]]></description><author>Paolo Roberti Antonio Nicolò Massimo Morelli</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16051-2</guid></item></channel></rss>
