We study global coordination games of regime change in two regions linked by an initially unobserved macro shock. A crisis in region 1 is a wake-up
call to investors in region 2. It induces them to reassess the regional fundamental and acquire information about the macro shock. Contagion can occur even after investors learn that region 2 has no ex-post exposure to region 1. We explore normative and testable implications of
the model. In particular, our results rationalize evidence about contagious currency crises and bank runs after wake-up calls and provide some guidance for future empirical work.]]></description><author>Toni Ahnert, Christoph Bertsch</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16809</guid></item><item><title>Opening Heaven’s Door: Public Opinion and Congressional Votes on the 1965 Immigration Act</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16808</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Giovanni Facchini, Timothy Hatton, Max Steinhardt.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-13 00:00:00.</b> <p> The Immigration Act of 1965 marked a dramatic shift in policy and one with major long term consequences for the volume and composition of immigration to the United States. Here we explore the political economy of a reform that has been overshadowed by the Civil Rights and Great Society programs. We find that public opinion was against expanding immigration, but it was more favorable to abolishing the old country of origin quota system. Votes in the House of Representatives and the Senate were more closely linked to opinion on abolishing the country of origin quotas than to public opinion on the volume of immigration. Support for immigration reform initially followed in the slipstream of civil rights legislation both among members of Congress and their constituents. The final House vote, on a more restrictive version of the bill, was instead more detached from state-level public opinion on civil rights and gained more support from those whose constituents wanted to see immigration decreased.]]></description><author>Giovanni Facchini, Timothy Hatton, Max Steinhardt</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16808</guid></item><item><title>Keeping the Agents in the Dark: Private Disclosures in Competing Mechanisms</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16807</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Andrea Attar, Eloisa Campioni, Thomas Mariotti, Alessandro Pavan.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-12 00:00:00.</b> <p> Abstract N/A]]></description><author>Andrea Attar, Eloisa Campioni, Thomas Mariotti, Alessandro Pavan</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16807</guid></item><item><title>Superstar Returns</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16806</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Francisco Amaral, Sebastian Kohl, Martin Dohmen, Moritz Schularick.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-12 00:00:00.</b> <p> We study long-term returns on residential real estate in 27 "superstar" cities in 15 countries over 150 years.

House prices tend to grow faster in the superstars, but rent returns are substantially greater outside the big agglomerations, resulting in higher long-run total returns.

It develops a tractable multisector model of the economy in which complementarity across inputs causes aggregate activity to be left skewed with countercyclical volatility. We then examine implications of the model regarding the time-series skewness of activity at the sector level, cyclicality of dispersion and skewness across sectors, and the conditional covariances of sector growth rates, finding support for each in the data. The empirical skewness of employment growth, industrial production growth, and stock returns increases with the level of aggregation, which is consistent with the model's implication that it is the nonlinearity in the production structure of the economy that generates the skewness. Other prominent models of asymmetry are not able to simultaneously match the range of empirical facts that the production network model can.]]></description><author>Ian Dew-Becker, Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi, Andrea Vedolin</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16804</guid></item><item><title>Deals That Start When You Sign Them</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16803</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Robert Gibbons.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-10 00:00:00.</b> <p> This essay explores six sentences from Oliver Williamson- five providing context and the sixth the central topic.

We study how parties build relational contracts that achieve this goal. We focus on the "clarity problem"-whether parties have a shared understanding of the promises they make each other. Specifically, (a) a buyer and seller play a trading game in several periods, (b) they know their environment will change but do not know how, and (c) before any trading occurs they can reach a non-binding agreement about how to play the entire game. We hypothesize that pairs whose initial agreement defines a broad principle rather than a narrow rule will be more successful in solving the clarity problem and in achieving efficient adaptation after unforeseen change. In our Baseline condition, we indeed observe that pairs who articulated principles achieved significantly higher performance after change occurred. Underlying this correlation, we also find that pairs with principle-based agreements were more likely both to expect and to take actions that were consistent with what their agreement prescribed. To investigate a causal link between principle-based agreements and performance, we implemented a "Nudge" intervention that induced more pairs to articulate principles. The intervention succeeded in co- ordinating more pairs on efficient quality immediately after the unforeseen change, but it failed to coordinate expectations on price, ultimately leading to conflicts and preventing an increase in long-run performance after the shock. Our results suggest that (1) principle-based agreements may improve organizational performance, but that (2) high-performing relational contracts may be difficult to build.]]></description><author>Robert Gibbons, Manuel Grieder, Holger Herz, Christian Zehnder</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16802</guid></item><item><title>Cross-verification and Persuasive Cheap Talk</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16801</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Alp Atakan, Mehmet Ekmekci, Ludovic Renou.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-10 00:00:00.</b> <p> We study a cheap-talk game where two experts first choose what information to acquire and then offer advice to a decision-maker whose actions affect the wel- fare of all.

Although the rise in public debt and its policy implications have received much attention recently, the rise in corporate debt has received less so. We argue that high levels of corporate debt may impede the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and make it less effective in controlling inflation. In an environment with working capital financing requirements, when firms' indebtedness is sufficiently high, the income effect of higher nominal interest rates offsets or even dominates its usual negative substitution effect on aggregate demand and is quantitatively important. This mechanism is independent of standard financial and nominal frictions and enhances the trade-off between inflation and output stabilisation.]]></description><author>Charles A. E. Goodhart, M.

We find that higher financial development fosters firm creation and firm expansion, which increases labor demand and leads to higher average wages, especially for cities initially located in banking deserts. The gains produced by higher financial development are not shared equally, but instead monotonically increase with workers' productivity, which leads to a substantial increase in inequality. This increase is concentrated in cities where the initial supply of skilled workers is low, showing that talent scarcity is an important driver of how financial development affects inequality.]]></description><author>Julia Fonseca, Adrien Matray</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16798</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Taxation with Multiple Incomes and Types</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16797</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Kevin Spiritus, Etienne Lehmann, Sander Renes, Floris Zoutman.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-09 00:00:00.</b> <p> We analyze the optimal nonlinear income tax schedule when taxpayers earn multiple incomes and differ along many unobserved dimensions.

Applied to the optimal taxation of couples, we find that optimal isotax curves are very close to linear and parallel.

We exploit properties of the primal and dual revenue based and cost based Solow residual. Ignoring fixed costs in production underestimates price-cost margins and overestimates excess profit margins. Using a 30 year panel of Belgian firms we estimate price cost margins of 25.9% on average, with fixed costs as a fraction of sales of 23.4%. Fixed costs as well as price-cost margins have declined in the last three decades, pushing excess profit margins close to zero, suggesting competitive markets. The presence of fixed costs implies that price-cost margins might change not only due to a change in firms' market power, but also due to changes in the production process (i.e., the mix between variable and fixed costs) or even due to a combination of both. Our novel methodology is able to distinguish these underlying mechanisms, thereby providing an additional layer of insight to the ongoing academic and policy debate on firms' market power.]]></description><author>Filip Abraham, Yannick Bormans, Jozef Konings, Werner Roeger</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16796</guid></item><item><title>The Premia on State-Contingent Sovereign Debt Instruments</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16795</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Deniz Igan, Taehoon Kim, Antoine Levy.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-09 00:00:00.</b> <p> State-contingent debt instruments such as GDP-linked warrants have garnered attention as a potential tool to help debt-stressed economies smooth repayments over business cycles, yet very few studies of the empirical properties of these instruments exist. This paper develops a general framework to estimate the time-varying risk premium of a state-contingent sovereign debt instrument. Our estimation framework applied to GDP-linked warrants issued by Argentina, Greece, and Ukraine reveals three stylized facts: (i) the risk premium in state-contingent
instruments is high and persistent; (ii) the risk premium exhibits a pro-cyclical pattern; and (iii) the liquidity premium is higher and more volatile than that for plain-vanilla government bonds issued by the same sovereign.

Households' desire to hedge against price volatility can generate price volatility in equilibrium, even absent fundamental risk. Fearing that asset prices may fall, risk-averse households demand safe assets from leveraged intermediaries, whose issuance of safe assets exposes the economy to self-fulfilling fire sales.

Typically, as economies move through the structural transformation, activities once conducted within the household are outsourced to the market. This has particular implications for women's time use. In this paper, we document that current patterns of female time use in home production in several African countries closely resemble historical time use patterns in the US. We highlight two stylized facts about women's time use in Africa. First, in North Africa, women spend very few hours in market work and female labor force participation overall is extremely low. Second, although extensive margin participation of women is high in sub-Saharan Africa, women tend to work in the market for only a few hours each week, with the rest of their work hours spent in home production. These two facts suggest two types of constraints that could slow down the reallocation of female
time from home to market as economies grow: Social norms related to women's market work, and a lack of infrastructure (e.g. household infrastructure and childcare facilities) to facilitate marketizing home production. We discuss recent empirical evidence related to each set of constraints and highlight new avenues for research.]]></description><author>Taryn Dinkelman, Liwa Rachel Ngai</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16792</guid></item><item><title>When Reality Bites: Local Deaths and Vaccine Take-Up</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16791</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Corrado Giulietti, Michael Vlassopoulos, Yves Zenou.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-08 00:00:00.</b> <p> In this study, we investigate whether COVID-19 deaths that occurred before vaccination rollouts impact subsequent vaccination take-ups.

In addition,  the share of ethnic minorities in a locality was negatively associated with vaccination rates, and that localities with a larger share of ethnic minorities increased their vaccination rates if they get exposed to more COVID-related-deaths.

In other words, sometimes it is impossible for more informed agents to know everything that less informed agents know. More broadly, define an information hierarchy to be a partially ordered set that ranks experiments in terms of informativeness. Is it the case that for any choice of experiments indexed on the hierarchy such that higher experiments are Blackwell more informative, there are signals that induce these experiments with higher signals being refinements of lower signals?

it possible to partially restore standard martingale convergence arguments that apply under correctly specified learning. Based on this, we derive general conditions to determine when beliefs in a given environment converge to some long-run belief either locally or globally (i.e., from some or all initial beliefs). We show that these conditions can be applied, first, to unify and generalize various convergence results in previously
studied settings. Second, they enable us to analyze environments where learning is "slow," such as costly information acquisition and sequential social learning. In such environments, we illustrate that even if agents learn the truth when they are correctly specified, vanishingly small amounts of misspecification can generate extreme failures of learning.]]></description><author>Mira Frick, Ryota Iijima, Yuhta Ishii</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16788</guid></item><item><title>The Anatomy of a Hospital System Merger: The Patient Did Not Respond Well to Treatment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16787</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Martin Gaynor, Adam Sacarny, Raffaella Sadun, Chad Syverson, Shruthi Venkatesh.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-07 00:00:00.</b> <p> Despite the continuing US hospital merger wave, it remains unclear how mergers change, or fail to change, hospital behavior and performance. We open the "black box" of hospital practices through a mega-merger between two for-profit chains.

In a randomized control trial, we provide groups of respondents from the Bundesbank Online Panel Households with information about a hypothetical alternative ECB monetary policy regime akin to the Federal Reserve's flexible average inflation targeting

When provided with additional assumptions about current inflation, individuals update their expected inflation path in line with the central banks' intentions. Individuals with a high trust in the ECB's ability to achieve price stability adjust their inflation expectations particularly strongly. We assess the economic significance of our findings by comparing two model economies under different monetary policy strategies, calibrated to match the difference in medium-term inflation expectations from our survey results. Inflation is substantially less volatile and the frequency of hitting the lower bound of interest rates considerably reduced

Using a large panel dataset of individuals drawn from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) for the US, we test whether residual wage gaps (once observed differences in productivity related to obesity are controlled for) are due to prejudice (taste-based discrimination) or statistical discrimination. Our main contribution is to examine how these two types of discrimination hinge on a wide range of obese individualsÂ´ specific job and occupational characteristics (drawn from the O * Net Online database). Our analysis sheds light on whether discrimination originates from the attitudes of clients, fellow-workers or employers. We find strong empirical evidence supporting taste-based discrimination against obese females, especially as they become older,  in jobs requiring frequent communication with either clients or employers. The evidence on this issue for males is weaker. These differences may be explained both by an over-representation of males among employers and different image concerns against people of the same gender]]></description><author>Juan J.

Modeling these increasingly important--but not yet fully understood--markets requires taking a stance on the shape of the demand curve and on when firms will be "in" or "out."  In an attempt to make further progress, we propose a framework with an intuitively-appealing demand curve (which we micro-found) and a new focality concept, based upon level-k thinking, that is both tractable and flexible enough to accommodate heterogeneous consumers.
 Under this focality concept, consumers' "impulses"--or level-0 thinking--determine the level of demand.  We show that firms may compete for the market itself rather than for the marginal consumer, and that a novel form of limit pricing arises in this case.  We characterize how competition changes with firms' technologies, consumers' impulses, and the strength of network externalities, and discuss how our theory informs debates on regulation of the new economy.]]></description><author>Robert Akerlof, Richard Holden, Luis Rayo</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16783</guid></item><item><title>Individual and Collective Information Acquisition: An Experimental Study</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16782</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Pellumb Reshidi, Alessandro Lizzeri, Leeat Yariv, Jimmy Chan, Wing Suen.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-07 00:00:00.</b> <p> Many committees---juries, political task forces, etc.---spend time gathering costly information before reaching a decision.

That is, higher transfers should be financed with lower income-tax progressivity. We next quantify the optimal fiscal plan in a rich dynamic model calibrated to the U.S. economy. Transfers should be generous and financed with moderate income-tax progressivity. To redistribute while preserving efficiency, average tax-and-transfer rates should be more progressive than marginal rates. Transfers, even if lump-sum, precisely allow to disentangle average from marginal rates. Targeted transfers further implement non-monotonic marginal rates, but generate only modest additional gains relative to a lump-sum transfer.

While research in economics had long acknowledged that trade with lower-income countries could raise income inequality in Europe and the US, empirical estimates indicated only a modest contribution of trade to growing national skill premia. However, if workers are not highly mobile across firms, industries and locations, then the unequal impacts of trade can manifest along different margins. Recent evidence from countries across Europe and the US shows that growing import competition from China differentially reduced earnings and employment rates for workers in more trade-exposed industries, and for the residents of more trade-exposed geographic regions. These adverse impacts were often largest for lower-skilled individuals. We show that domestic manufacturing employment declined much more in countries that saw a large growth of net imports from China (such as the UK and the US), than in countries that maintained relatively balanced trade with China (such as Germany and Switzerland). Drawing on a new analysis for the UK, we further show that trade with China contributed to job loss in manufacturing, but also to substantial declines in consumer prices. However, while the adverse labour market impacts were concentrated on specific groups of workers and regions, the consumer benefits from trade were widely dispersed in the population, and appear similarly large for high-income and low-income households. Globalisation has thus created pockets of losers, and recent evidence indicates that in addition to financial losses, residents of regions with greater exposure to import competition also suffer from higher crime rates, a deterioration of health outcomes, and a dissolution of traditional family structures. We argue that new import tariffs such as those imposed by the US in 2018 and 2019 are unlikely to help the losers from globalisation. Instead, displaced workers may be better supported by a combination of transfers to avert financial hardship, skills training that facilitate reintegration into the labour market, and place-based policies that stimulate job creation in depressed locations.]]></description><author>David Dorn, Peter Levell</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16780</guid></item><item><title>The Welfare Effects of Law Enforcement in the Illegal Money Lending Market</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16779</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Kaiwen Leong, Huailu Li, Nicola Pavanini, Christoph Walsh.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-05 00:00:00.</b> <p> We estimate a structural model of borrowing and lending in the illegal money lending market using a unique panel survey of 1,090 borrowers taking out 11,032 loans from loan sharks.

The crackdown raised interest rates, lowered the volume of loans, and lowered the welfare of borrowers. The welfare of lenders that conduct harassment more frequently fell, but less-harsh lenders gained through the higher interest rates.

For identification, we use bank-level commitments to carbon neutrality to proxy for changes in banks' green preferences and, via these bank commitments, shocks to firms with previous credit from these banks. We find that firms with higher (lower) scope-1 emission levels previously borrowing from banks making commitments subsequently receive less (more) total bank credit. The economic mechanism at play is bank credit supply, and results are consistent with bank preferences for green rather than differential response to an increased firm risk. The reduction in bank lending to brown firms triggers the reduction in these firms' total debt, leverage, total assets, and real investments. The effects are non-linear, with a strong cut (increase) in lending and investments for brown (green) firms, and mild effects for other firms. Despite the real and financial effects, we find no improvement in hard firm-level environmental scores for brown firms, but only evidence consistent with firms' greenwashing. Overall, our results suggest that banks affect carbon emissions via credit reallocation (from brown to green firms) rather than via providing loans to brown firms for the investment necessary to reduce carbon emissions.]]></description><author>Marcin Kacperczyk, José Luis Peydró</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16778</guid></item><item><title>Controlling Irregular Migration: Can a Market for Temporary Foreign Work Permits Help?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16777</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Emmanuelle Auriol, Alice Mesnard, Tiffanie Perrault.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-05 00:00:00.</b> <p> We study how temporary visa schemes can be designed to drive smugglers out of business while meeting labor market demand in host countries.

We show that these concerns have been overstated. A $100 oil scenario of the type discussed by many observers, would only briefly raise monthly headline inflation, before fading rather quickly. However, the short-run effects on headline inflation would be sizable. For example, on a year-over-year basis, headline PCE inflation would increase by 1.8 percentage points at the end of 2021 under this scenario, and by 0.4 percentage points at the end of 2022. In contrast, the impact on measures of core inflation such as trimmed mean PCE inflation is only 0.4 and 0.3 percentage points in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

The paper reports three main results. First, even before the pandemic, a rapid buildup of debt in emerging market and developing economies-dubbed the "fourth wave" of debt-had been underway. Because of the sharp increase in debt during the pandemic-induced global recession of 2020, the fourth wave of debt has turned into a tsunami and become even more dangerous. Second, five years after past global recessions, global government debt continued to increase. In light of this historical record, and given large financing gaps and significant investment needs in many countries, debt levels will likely continue to rise in the near future. Third, debt resolution has become more complicated because of a highly fragmented creditor base, a lack of transparency in debt reporting, and a legacy stock of government debt without collective action clauses. National policy makers and the global community need to act rapidly and forcefully ensure that the fourth wave does not end with a string of debt crises in emerging market and developing economies as earlier debt waves did.]]></description><author>M.

We exploit an exogenous historical shock on corporate donations to estimate their causal impact on the content of campaign communication.

We also find evidence that donations lead candidates from extreme parties to moderate their rhetoric â?? including shifts in the policy topics they advertise. Our findings may reflect a "quid-pro-quo effect" between donors and politicians, but they may also result from an "electoral effect": receiving expressive contributions from corporate donors affects the content of campaign messages because it changes candidates' perception of which issues matter most to voters.

We test for the existence of empty creditors by employing an exogenous change to the bankruptcy code in Germany that effectively removes their potential impact on CDS firms. Using a unique dataset on bank-firm CDS net notional and credit exposures we find that the probability of default for CDS firms drops when the effect of empty creditors is removed. This effect increases in the average CDS hedge position of a firm's creditors and in the concentration of the firm's debt. Firms with longer credit relationships, with higher average collateral ratios of their debt, and financially safer firms are less affected by empty creditors. Banks that are not capital constrained and that are liquidity constrained embed the empty creditor effect into their probability of default estimates of affected firms to a larger extent.

This paper investigates whether a low-capacity state can increase its tax revenue through the optimal assignment of its tax collectors. We study the two-stage random assignment of property tax collectors (i) into teams and (ii) to neighborhoods in a large Congolese city. The optimal assignment involves positive assortative matching on both dimensions: high (low) ability collectors should be paired together, and high (low) ability teams should be paired with high (low) payment propensity households. Positive assortative matching stems from complementarities in collector-to-collector and collector-to-household match types. We provide evidence that these complementarities reflect in part high-ability collectors exerting greater effort when matched with other high-ability collectors. Implementing the optimal assignment would increase tax compliance by an estimated 37% relative to the status quo (random) assignment. By contrast, to achieve a similar increase under the status quo assignment, the government would have to replace 63% of low-ability collectors with high-ability ones or to increase collectors' performance wages by 69%.]]></description><author>Augustin Bergeron, Pedro Bessone, John Kabeya Kabeya, Gabriel Tourek, Jonathan Weigel</author><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16771</guid></item><item><title>Discontinuities in the Age-Victimization Profile and the Determinants of Victimization</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16770</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Anna Bindler, Randi Hjalmarsson, Nadine Ketel, Andreea Mitrut.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-03 00:00:00.</b> <p> Many rights are conferred on Dutch youth at ages 16 and 18.

a standard  tool for models in international trade and macroeconomics. Inter-variety substitution in this 
model follows a simple share proportionality rule. In contrast, the 
standard toolkit in industrial organization (IO)  estimates a demand system in which cross-elasticities 
depend on similarity in observable attributes. The gain in realism from the IO approach comes at the 
expense of requiring richer data and greater computational challenges. This paper uses the dataset of 
Berry et al. (1995),  who established the modern IO  method, to simulate counterfactual trade policy 
experiments. We use the CES model  as an approximation of the more 
complex underlying demand system and market structure. Although the CES model omits key elements 
of the data generating process, the errors are offsetting, leading to reasonably accurate counterfactual predictions. 
For aggregate outcomes, it turns out that incorporating non-unitary pass-through matters more than fixing 
over-simplified substitution patterns. We do so by extending the commonly used methods of Exact Hat Algebra 
and tariff elasticity estimation to take into account oligopoly.]]></description><author>Keith Head, Thierry Mayer</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16762</guid></item><item><title>The Gender Gap at the Top: How Network Size and Composition Impact CEO Pay</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16761</link><description><![CDATA[<i>José Tavares, Sharmin Sazedj.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-29 00:00:00.</b> <p> This paper advances the literature on the gender pay gap amongst top managers, by
explicitly assessing the relevance of professional networks. We use data on the universe of
firms in Portugal, where female top managers earn 25% less than their male counterparts,
conditional on age, education and firm tenure. We estimate that 20% of the above femalemale earnings difference is due to differences in networks across gender. Making use
of Gelbach's decomposition, we find that the network effect can be ascribed to firm
sorting, i.e. well-connected managers tend to be associated to higher paying firms. By
focusing on episodes of transitions between firms, and relying on a propensity score
matching procedure, we estimate that around 90% of the gender pay gap emerges
during the hiring process, and is only slightly aggravated thereafter, due to biased career
progression. Roughly one third of the gender gap can be attributed to firm sorting, two
thirds of which to differences in networks. We then examine the gender composition
of female and male CEOs' networks. While we find no evidence that females benefit
differently from network size, we do find evidence that male connections are more
valuable. If, however, we proxy for the inner circle of a manager, taking into account
the proximity of connections, we conclude that same gender connections gain relevance.
These results suggest that connections between females do play an important role in the
existing corporate framework where males are over-represented. We conclude that policies
furthering female representation in leadership positions can have positive spillover effect
for other women.]]></description><author>José Tavares, Sharmin Sazedj</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16761</guid></item><item><title>Real-Time Forecasting with a (Standard) Mixed-Frequency VAR During a Pandemic</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16760</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Frank Schorfheide, Dongho Song.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-29 00:00:00.</b> <p> We resuscitated the mixed-frequency vector autoregression (MF-VAR) developed in Schorfheide and Song (2015, JBES) to generate macroeconomic forecasts for the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic in real time.

We study how a country's production network is affected by a devastating but localized conflict. Using unique transaction-level data on Ukrainian railway shipments, we uncover several novel indirect effects of conflict on firms. First, we document substantial propagation effects on interfirm trade---trade declines even between partners outside the conflict areas if one of them had traded with those areas before the start of the war. The magnitude of such second-degree effect of conflict is one-third of the first-degree effect. Ignoring this propagation would lead to an underestimate of the total impact of conflict on trade by about 67%. Second, war induces sudden changes in the production-network structure that influence firm performance. Specifically, we find that firms that exogenously became more central---after the conflict practically cut off certain regions from the rest of Ukraine---received a relative boost to their revenues and profits. Finally, in a production-network model, we separately estimate the effects of the exogenous firm removal and the subsequent endogenous network adjustment on firm revenue distribution. At the median, network adjustment compensates for 80% of the network-destruction effect a year after the conflict onset.]]></description><author>Vasily Korovkin, Alexey Makarin</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16759</guid></item><item><title>Inflation Narratives</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16758</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Peter Andre, Ingar Haaland, Christopher Roth, Johannes Wohlfart.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-28 00:00:00.</b> <p> We provide evidence on the stories that people tell to explain a historically notable rise in inflation using samples of experts, U.S. households, and managers.

While it involves updating the ledger through a decentralized consensus on the unique truth, the robustness of the equilibrium that supports this consensus depends on who has access to the ledger and how it can be updated. To find the optimal solution, Buterin's "scalability trilemma" needs to be addressed, so that a workable balance can be found between decentralization, security (i.e. a robust consensus), and scale (the efficient volume of transactions). Using a global game analysis of an exchange economy with credit, we solve for the optimal ledger design that balances the three objectives of this trilemma. We characterize the optimal number of validators, supermajority threshold, fees and transaction size. When intertemporal incentives are strong, a centralized ledger is always optimal. Otherwise, decentralization may be optimal, and validators need to be selected from the set of users of the system.]]></description><author>Raphael Auer, Hyun Song Shin, Cyril Monnet</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16752</guid></item><item><title>Non-Standard Errors</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16751</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Albert Menkveld, Anna Dreber, Felix Holzmeister, Juergen Huber, Magnus Johannesson, Michael Kirchler, Sebastian Neusüess, Michael Razen, Utz Weitzel, Christian C P Wolff.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-23 00:00:00.</b> <p> In statistics, samples are drawn from a population in a data generating process (DGP).

What has been the impact of these elections on the spread of COVID-19 in France? Answering this question leads to intricate econometric issues as omitted variables may drive both epidemiological dynamics and electoral turnout, and as a national lockdown was imposed almost at the same time as the elections. In order to disentangle the effect of the elections from that of confounding factors, we first predict each dÃ©partement's own epidemiological dynamics using information up to the election to calibrate a standard logistic model. We then take advantage of differences in electoral turnout across dÃ©partements to identify the impact of the election on prediction errors in hospitalizations. We report a detrimental effect of the first round of the election in locations that were at relatively advanced stages of the epidemic by the time of the election.

In addition, banks reallocate a relatively larger share of their fossil loan portfolio to countries without a carbon tax.

We examine the impact of the world's first large-scale rural public housing scheme on the long-term dynamics of rural population, specifically the case of Ireland's Labourers Acts. We link detailed data on the location of over 45,000 heavily subsidized cottages for agricultural laborers built 1883-1915 in over 200 districts to decennial Censuses between 1841 and 2002. We examine how the density of this social housing, which effectively halved rents for landless laborers, affected subsequent population change and find significant persistence in the effect of this treatment on the population. These findings are from specifications that include other factors plausibly related to future population growth, including initial housing stock, land values and population density, as well as distance to urban centres. A causal interpretation is supported by an assessment of pre-trends, by no effect of cottages authorized but not built and by an IV approach that exploits a 1906 limit on legal costs.

The literature on trade and inequality is in fact exceptionally rich, with important theoretical insights as well as extensive empirical findings that sheds light on this recent experience. Some of the key results of this literature, discussed here, are as follows: Redistribution is the flip side of the gains from trade, and it becomes larger relative to net gains from trade in the advanced stages of globalization. Compensation is difficult for both economic and political reasons. International trade often differs from other market exchanges, raising fairness concerns in ways that domestic markets do not.

Theoretically, we show that it is possible for international trade to increase capability growth in all countries and, in turn, to push all countries up the development ladder. This occurs because: (i) the average complexity of a country's industry mix raises its capability growth, and (ii) foreign competition is tougher in less complex sectors for all countries. Empirically, we provide causal evidence consistent with (i) using the entry of countries into the World Trade Organization as an instrumental variable for other countries' patterns of specialization.

Counties with a larger Southern white share by 1940 exhibited growing support for right-wing politics throughout the 20th century and beyond. Racial animus, religious conservatism, and localist attitudes among the Southern white diaspora hastened partisan realignment as the Republican Party found fresh support for the Southern strategy outside the South. Their congressional representatives were more likely to oppose politically liberal legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and to object to the Electoral College count in 2021.

It first documents the size of the shock to net revenues from international travel and tourism for the balance of payments. For the median highly tourism-dependent economy the shock exceeded 10 percentage points of GDP, leading to a sizable current account deterioration. Indeed, empirical evidence suggests that current account adjustment in 2020 relative to pre-crisis forecasts was driven to an important extent by the collapse in revenues and expenditures on international travel as well as by the collapse in oil prices. On the economic growth front, the paper shows that the share of tourism activities in GDP is the single most important predictor of the growth shortfall in 2020 triggered by the COVID-19 crisis across the world as well as within the eurozone, even when compared to a variety of measures of the severity of the pandemic.]]></description><author>Gian Maria Milesi Ferretti</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16738</guid></item><item><title>Short-term political memory and the inevitability of polarisation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16737</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Ronny Razin, Gilat Levy.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-20 00:00:00.</b> <p> In this paper we explore the effect of short memories on political outcomes in a model in which politics is viewed as a collective learning process .

Workers differ in abilities. Jobs differ in productivities and amenities. A planner uses affine tax functions to finance lump-sum transfers to all workers and unemployment benefits. The competitive search equilibrium maximizes after-tax utility subject to resource constraints and the tax policy. A higher tax rate distorts search effort, job ranking and vacancy creation. Distortions vary on the job ladder, but always result in deadweight losses. We calibrate the model using matched employer-employee data from Denmark. The marginal deadweight loss is 33 percent of the tax base, and primarily arise from distorted search effort and vacancy creation.

This paper examines the extent to which this phenomenon is more general by testing the hypothesis that the ratio of current mortality to lagged infections is decreasing in the total number of vaccines per one hundred individuals. This is done in a pooled time-series, cross-section sample with weekly observations for up to 208 countries. The main conclusion from the statistical analysis is that, passed a certain threshold, vaccines moderate the share of mortality from a given pool of lagged infections. This is essentially a favorable shift in the tradeoff between life preservation and economic performance. Controlling for income per capita, stringency of containment measures, and the fraction of recovered and old individuals, estimation is carried out by linear least squares, with standard errors clustered by country and region. The main result is robust to sensitivity analysis with a logarithmic specification. The practical lesson is that, in the presence of a sufficiently high share of inoculated individuals, governments can shade down containment measures, even as infections are still rampant, without significant adverse effects on mortality.]]></description><author>Joshua Aizenman, Alex Cukierman, Yothin Jinjarak, Weining Xin</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16728</guid></item><item><title>Loan Guarantees, Bank Lending and Credit Risk Reallocation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16727</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Carlo Altavilla, Andrew Ellul, Marco Pagano, Andrea Polo, Thomas Vlassopoulos.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-15 00:00:00.</b> <p> We investigate whether government credit guarantee schemes, extensively used at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, led to substitution of non-guaranteed with guaranteed credit rather than fully adding to the supply of lending.

First, guaranteed loans were mostly extended to small but comparatively creditworthy firms in sectors severely affected by the pandemic, borrowing from large, liquid and well-capitalized banks. Second, guaranteed loans partially substitute pre-existing non-guaranteed debt. For firms borrowing from multiple banks, the substitution mainly arises from the lending behavior of the bank extending guaranteed loans. Substitution was highest for funding granted to riskier and smaller firms in sectors more affected by the pandemic, and borrowing from larger and stronger banks.

firm demands. Demand height and width drive bids in a position auction and enable
us to bridge insights from the ordered search literature to those in the position auction
literature. Equilibrium pricing implies that the marginal consumer's surplus decreases
down the search order, so consumers optimally follow the firms' position ordering. A
firm suffers from "business stealing" by firms that precede it and "search appeal" from
subsequent firms. We find rankings that achieve the maximal joint profit, social welfare,
or consumer surplus by constructing firm-specific scores. A generalized second price
auction for positions endogenizes equilibrium orders and bids are driven by position

We find that manufacturing plant closures and downsizing lead to a decline in subsequent population growth, especially among the young, those of working age, migrants, and the less skilled. There are also sizable negative effects on the local employment in other industries, which can explain why such negative local labor demand shocks affect population dynamics.

This happened even though the shock, implemented by a right-wing party, induced a contraction in manufacturing and formal employment in the more affected regions, and despite the left's identification with protectionist policies. To rationalize this response, we consider a new institutional channel for the political effects of trade shocks: the weakening of labor unions. We provide support for this mechanism in two steps. First, we show that union presence---proxied by the number of workers directly employed by unions, by union density, and by the number of union establishments---declined in regions that became more exposed to foreign competition. Second, we show that the negative effect of tariff reductions on the votes for the left was driven exclusively by political parties with historical links to unions. Furthermore, the impact of the trade liberalization on the vote share of these parties was significant only in regions that had unions operating before the reform. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that tariff cuts reduced the vote share of the left partly through the weakening of labor unions. This institutional channel is fundamentally different from the individual-level responses, motivated by economic or identity concerns, that have been considered in the literature.]]></description><author>Pedro Ogeda, Emanuel Ornelas, Rodrigo Soares</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16721</guid></item><item><title>Falling Interest Rates and Credit Misallocation: Lessons from General Equilibrium</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16720</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Vladimir Asriyan, Luc Laeven, Alberto Martin, Alejandro Van der Ghote, Victoria Vanasco.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-13 00:00:00.</b> <p> What is the effect of declining interest rates on the efficiency of resource allocation and overall economic activity? We study this question in a setting in which entrepreneurs with different productivities invest in capital, subject to financial frictions. We show that a fall in the interest rate has an ambiguous effect on aggregate output. In partial equilibrium, a lower interest rate raises aggregate investment both by relaxing financial constraints and by prompting relatively less productive entrepreneurs to invest. In general equilibrium, this higher demand for capital raises its price and crowds out investment by more productive entrepreneurs. When this crowding-out effect is strong enough, a fall in
the interest rate becomes contractionary. Moreover, in a dynamic setup, such reallocation effects among entrepreneurs interact with the classic balance-sheet channel, giving rise to a boom-bust impulse response of output to a fall in the interest rate. We show that these
reallocation effects are quantitatively important in a calibrated version of the model, and we provide evidence in support of our mechanism using US data.]]></description><author>Vladimir Asriyan, Luc Laeven, Alberto Martin, Alejandro Van der Ghote, Victoria Vanasco</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16720</guid></item><item><title>Democracy, Growth, Heterogeneity, and Robustness</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16719</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Markus Eberhardt.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-13 00:00:00.</b> <p> I motivate and empirically investigate differential long-run growth effects of democratisation across countries.

This paper presents a simple model that accounts for this fact. In the model, changes in foreign appetite for domestic assets lead to a trade-off between stabilizing the tradable sector and stabilizing the nontradable sector. The model is consistent with a number of stylized facts about the impact of the global financial cycle on emerging market economies, and on the policies used by emerging markets to mitigate this impact.

These incentives are exacerbated when jurisdictions are local and the downstream producer can approach
courts sequentially. The informational spillovers across trials imply that this firm often finds optimal to go to court aiming to invalidate the patent in a jurisdiction due to the knock-on effect on future jurisdictions. This process results in excessive litigation compared to when the jurisdiction is global.

In this paper I examine the determinants of recognition rates for asylum applicants from 65 origin countries to 20 European destinations from 2003 to 2017. The outcomes of the EU directives have been mixed, but taken together they are associated with increased recognition rates. These made a modest contribution to the trend increase in recognition rates most of which is due to increased political terror and human rights repression in origin countries.

We document that (i) a demographic transition has been completed or is ongoing in nearly every country; (ii) the speed of transition has increased over time; and (iii) having more neighbors that have started the transition is associated with a higher probability of a country beginning its own transition. To account for these observations, we build a quantitative model in which parents choose child quantity and educational quality.

We consider two firms offering nonlinear contracts to a unit mass of prospective workers. Firms may differ in their marginal productivity, while workers are heterogeneous in their ability (high or low), and in their taste for being employed by any of the two firms. Workers receive a utility premium when employed by the firm hiring the workforce with larger average ability and they suffer a utility loss in the opposite case. These premiums/losses are endogenously determined.
When workers' ability is observable and the difference in firms' marginal productivities is strictly positive, we show that CfCA increases surplus but it also increases firms' competition for high-ability workers. As a result, CfCA benefits high-ability workers but is detrimental to firms. In addition, CfCA exacerbates the existing distortion in sorting of high-ability workers to firms: too many workers are hired by the least efficient firm. When ability is not observable, the additional surplus appropriated by high-ability workers is eroded by overincentivization (countervailing incentives) and the more so when CfCA is high. Conversely, high-types' sorting improves when CfCA is low and remains the same when it is high.]]></description><author>Francesca Barigozzi, Helmuth Cremer</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16704</guid></item><item><title>AI-tocracy</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16703</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Martin Beraja, Andrew Kao, David Yang, Noam Yuchtman.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-08 00:00:00.</b> <p> Can frontier innovation be sustained under autocracy?

To do so, we gather comprehensive data on AI firms and government procurement contracts, as well as on social unrest across China during the last decade.

We then show that AI innovation benefits from autocrats' suppression of unrest: the contracted AI firms innovate more both for the government and commercial markets.

Our results suggest that, prior to the fraud revelation, managers' short decision horizons and aversion to short-term risk or uncertainty enables influential customers to demand relationship-specific innovation when their bargaining power is stronger, leading to suboptimal diversification.

However, it did not translate into increased bank assets and deposits as a share of national income. The banking crisis of the Great Depression ended the network expansion and reversed part of it, but the number of bank branches remained four times greater than before the war (though the French population was similar in 1910 and 1930). The distinction between indicators of credit or deposits on GDP and indicators of the density of the banking network challenges the thesis of the Great Reversal and improves understanding of the evolution of the banking system during the interwar period. We argue that inflation and increased competition explain the disconnect between the evolution of branches and the real volume of banking activity.]]></description><author>Emilie Bonhoure, Hadrien Clausse, Eric Monnet, Angelo Riva</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16698</guid></item><item><title>Contracts versus Communication</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16697</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Andreas Blume, Inga Deimen, Sean Inoue.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-07 00:00:00.</b> <p> We consider the trade-off a principal faces who has to choose between either controlling an agent's action through an incomplete contract or guiding him through non-binding communication.  The principal anticipates receiving private information and must hire an agent to take an action on her behalf. Contracts can only specify a limited number of actions as a function of the state. The principal is at liberty not to specify actions for some of the states. States not covered by the contract induce a communication game.  We show that close alignment of interests favors communication and, thus, ceding authority to the agent, while strong misalignment favors reliance on contracts. In the uniform-quadratic environment  whenever an optimal contract induces influential communication, it splits the communication region: there are at least two communication actions separated by contract actions. For sufficiently closely aligned interests, it is also the case that communication splits the contract region: there are at least two contract actions separated by a communication action.
The separation of distinct communication events relaxes incentive compatibility constraints and, therefore, helps equalize the size of communication events. This highlights the dual role of contracting as both substituting for and facilitating communication -- the principal uses contracts not only to impose her favorite actions, but also to structure communication.]]></description><author>Andreas Blume, Inga Deimen, Sean Inoue</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16697</guid></item><item><title>Institutional Integration and Productivity Growth: Evidence from the 1995 Enlargement of the European Union</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16696</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Nauro Campos, Fabrizio Coricelli, Emanuele Franceschi.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-04 00:00:00.</b> <p> This paper studies the productivity effects of integration deepening.

The shock plateaued in 2010, enabling analysis of its effects for nearly a decade past its culmination. Adverse impacts of import competition on manufacturing employment, overall employment-population ratios, and income per capita in more trade-exposed U.S. commuting zones are present out to 2019. Over the full study period, greater import competition implies a reduction in the manufacturing employment-population ratio of 1.54 percentage points, which is 55% of the observed change in the value, and the absorption of 86% of this net job loss via a corresponding decrease in the overall employment rate. Reductions in population headcounts, which indicate net out-migration, register only for foreign-born workers and the native-born 25-39 years old, implying that exit from work is a primary means of adjustment to trade-induced contractions in labor demand. More negatively affected regions see modest increases in the uptake of government transfers, but these transfers primarily take the form of Social Security and Medicare benefits. Adverse outcomes are more acute in regions that initially had fewer college-educated workers and were more industrially specialized. Impacts are qualitatively-but not quantitatively-similar to those caused by the decline of employment in coal production since the 1980s, indicating that the China trade shock holds lessons for other episodes of localized job loss. Import competition from China induced changes in income per capita across local labor markets that are much larger than the spatial heterogeneity of income effects predicted by standard quantitative trade models. Even using higher-end estimates of the consumer benefits of rising trade with China, a substantial fraction of commuting zones appears to have suffered absolute declines in average real incomes.]]></description><author>David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon Hanson</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16688</guid></item><item><title>The Debt Capacity of a Government</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16687</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Bernard Dumas, Paul Ehling, Chunyu Yang.</i> <p> <b>2021-11-02 00:00:00.</b> <p> In a deterministic overlapping-generations economy with production and physical capital, the price of debt can be positive without any budget surpluses being in the offing, because debt incorporates a rational bubble. Yet the dynamics of debt remain a function of the dynamics of the primary budget deficit. As a way to study their joint behavior, we endogenize a structural deficit in the form of an underfunded social-security scheme. We define debt capacity as the level of debt that can be just sustained without a change of policy all the way to an unstable steady state. When it starts below the capacity, the debt converges to a stable steady state, in which the bubble is sustained. Above capacity the bubble unravels and the deficit cannot be financed.

Coordinating on the efficient and fair long run outcome (EFO) requires participants to share intentions and beliefs. This exercise is arguably complex in the battle of the sexes, as it requires taking turns between the two static Nash equilibria, hence coordinating the strategies. By contrast, in the stag hunt it only requires repeating the action that leads to the Pareto efficient outcome, hence coordinating the actions. We obtain four main findings. First, for both games, we show a significant and remarkably stable increase in the ability to coordinate on the EFO with age. Second, the majority of participants in all ages adhere to one of a small number of relatively simple strategies. Third, jointly profitable outcomes are more prevalent in the stag hunt than in the battle of the sexes. Last, behavior improves between the first and second supergame.

Three primitive characteristics of a BG determine its optimal choice of hierarchical structure: production efficiency and two dimensions of problem solving efficiency related to supervising knowledge creation and handling associated communication across subsidiaries.

The number of people affected by solitude has been rising for some time and the Covid-19 pandemic has brought this trend to the fore. Yet, we know next to nothing about the aggregate subnational economic consequences of the rise in solitude. In this paper we analyse the consequences of solitude on regional economic performance across Europe, distinguishing between two of its key dimensions: alone living, proxied by the regional share of the population in one-person households; and loneliness, proxied by the aggregate share of social interactions. We find that solitude has important implications for economic development, but that these go in different directions. While alone living is a substantial driver of economic growth across European regions, high shares of lonely people undermine it. The connection of loneliness with economic growth is, however, dependent on the frequency of in-person meetings, with large shares of the population meeting others on a weekly basis yielding the best economic returns.]]></description><author>Chiara Burlina, Andrés Rodríguez-Pose</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16674</guid></item><item><title>The effects of financial incentives and disincentives on teachers' retirement decisions: Evidence from the 2003 French pension reform</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16673</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Denis Fougere, Pierre Gouëdard.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-28 00:00:00.</b> <p> Abstract N/A]]></description><author>Denis Fougere, Pierre Gouëdard</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16673</guid></item><item><title>Risks and global supply chains: What we know and what we need to know</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16672</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Richard Baldwin, Rebecca Freeman.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-28 00:00:00.</b> <p> Recent supply disruptions catapulted the issue of risk in global supply chains (GSCs) to the top of policy agendas and created the impression that shortages would have been less severe if GSCs were either shorter and more domestic, or more diversified. But is this right? We start our answer by reviewing studies that look at risks to and from GSCs, and how GSCs have recovered from past shocks. We then look at whether GSCs are too risky starting with business research on how firms approach the cost-resiliency trade-off. We propose the risk-versus-reward framework from portfolio theory as a good way to evaluate whether anti-risk policy is justified. We then discuss how exposures to foreign shocks are measured and argue that exposure is higher than direct indicators imply. Finally, we consider the future of GSCs in light of current policy proposals and advancing technology before pointing to the rich menu of topics for future research on the risk-GSC nexus.]]></description><author>Richard Baldwin, Rebecca Freeman</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16672</guid></item><item><title>Understanding the role of firms in the gender wage gap over time, over the life cycle, and across worker types</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16671</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Marco Guido Palladino, Alexandra Roulet, Mark Stabile.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-28 00:00:00.</b> <p> Evidence across many jurisdictions suggests that firm pay premiums contribute meaningfully to the gender wage gap and that this is largely driven by sorting of women into lower paying firms rather than within firm gender differences in pay premiums. We build on this evidence using a cluster-based approach which allows us to relax the usual sample restrictions, to use repeated 2 year panels to examine how the contribution of firms to the gender wage gap has changed over time, to compute age-specific estimates of the gender gap in firm pay premium to document changes over the life cycle, and to explore whether there are complementarities between worker types and firm effects and how these differ by gender. We show that lifting the dual connected set restriction reveals a slightly larger contribution of firms to the gender wage gap, and more strikingly a higher within firm component. Further, the gender gap in firm pay premiums remained fairly constant between 1995 and 2015 (as did the decomposition of this gap) but represents an increasing share of the overall gender wage gap over time. It increases with age, exclusively driven by an increase of the sorting of women into lower paying firms.

First, we demonstrate that the benefits of acquiring more precise information about the state of the economy depend crucially on household wealth. Second, we show that such heterogeneous incentives to acquire information combine with the strategic substitutability of savings choices to imply that equilibria in which households acquire the same information do not exist for plausible information costs.

In line with banks use cross-border lending as a regulatory arbitrage tool, the increase in cross-border lending occurs only if banks' home countries have more stringent climate policy compared to their borrowers' countries.

closures from Burbio, we quantify the heterogeneous impact of school closures during the
Corona crisis on children affected at different ages and coming from households with different
parental characteristics. Our data suggests that secondary schools were closed for
in-person learning for longer periods than elementary schools (implying that younger children
experienced less school closures than older children), and that private schools experienced
shorter closures than public schools, and schools in poorer U.S. counties experienced
shorter school closures. We then extend the structural life cycle model of private and
public schooling investments studied in Fuchs-SchÃ¼ndeln, Krueger, Ludwig, and Popova
(2021) to include the choice of parents whether to send their children to private schools,
empirically discipline it with data on parental investments from the PSID, and then feed
into the model the school closure measures from our empirical analysis to quantify the
long-run consequences of the Covid-19 school closures on the cohorts of children currently
in school. Future earnings- and welfare losses are largest for children that started public
secondary schools at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. Comparing children from the top to
children from the bottom quartile of the income distribution, welfare losses are ca. 0.8
percentage points larger for the poorer children if school closures were unrelated to income.
Accounting for the longer school closures in richer counties reduces this gap by about 1/3.
A policy intervention that extends schools by 3 months (6 weeks in the next two summers)
generates significant welfare gains for the children and raises future tax revenues approximately
sufficient to pay for the cost of this schooling expansion.]]></description><author>Nicola Fuchs-Schündeln, Dirk Krueger, Andre Kurmann, Etienne Lale, Alexander Ludwig, Irina Popova</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16663</guid></item><item><title>Water Treatment and Child Mortality: Evidence from Kenya</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16662</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Michael Kremer.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-21 00:00:00.</b> <p> Each year, around 500,000 children under 5 die from diarrhea, making it the third- leading cause of death in this age group.

These gaps seemingly imply frictions to human mobility. In this paper, we present new evidence on mobility within three African countries. We use a novel data source that provides highly detailed location data on more than one million smartphone devices across three large African countries for an entire year. This allows us to examine high-frequency mobility patterns for a subset of people for whom we can determine home locations confidently. The data offer insights into patterns of mobility, with corresponding implications for the nature and extent of mobility frictions. In particular, our data point to the ubiquity of relatively high-frequency journeys within countries -- i.e., visits. We observe that many users travel to  relatively distant within-country locations, with big cities acting as particularly attractive magnets. We develop a conceptual framework that characterizes the role of visits for individuals  and provides a number of testable predictions that are consistent with the movement patterns that we observe in the data. The analysis suggests that distance-linked mobility costs are not so high as to discourage travel. In fact, travel enables users to benefit from the opportunities that large cities provide, without having to incur the costs of relocation. The frictions sustaining spatial and sectoral gaps thus seem  to reflect deep fixed costs associated with the dislocations of migration and sectoral change, rather than the direct costs of movement.]]></description><author>Douglas Gollin, Martina Kirchberger, Paul Blanchard</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16661</guid></item><item><title>A Safe Harbor: Wealth-Income Ratios in Switzerland Over the 20th Century and the Role of Housing Prices</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16660</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Isabel Z.

the efficiency of credit allocation and long-term economic outcomes. When transitory
demand or productivity shocks are small, conventional monetary policy can restore
efficient bank lending and production by lowering interest rates. For moderately large
shocks, however, conventional policy may hit the effective lower bound, necessitating
unconventional policy such as regulatory forbearance towards banks to stabilize the
economy. Aggressive unconventional policy runs the risk of introducing zombie lending and a "diabolical sorting", whereby low-capitalization banks extend new credit or
evergreen existing loans to low-productivity firms. In a dynamic setting, policy aimed
at avoiding short-term recessions can be trapped into protracted excessive forbearance due to congestion externalities imposed by zombie lending on healthier firms.
The resulting economic sclerosis transforms transitory shocks into phases of delayed
recovery and potentially permanent output losses. Our model highlights the importance of maintaining a well-capitalized banking system to avoid such policy traps as
not raising capital requirements upfront but raising them significantly upon the arrival
of shocks can also backfire by encouraging zombie lending.]]></description><author>Viral Acharya, Simone Lenzu, Olivier Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16658</guid></item><item><title>How Do Acquisitions Affect the Mental Health of Employees?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16657</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Laurent Bach, Ramin Baghai, Marieke Bos, Rui Silva.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-21 00:00:00.</b> <p> Using employer-employee level data linked to individual health records, we document that the incidence of stress, anxiety, depression, psychiatric medication usage, and even suicide increase following acquisitions.

In our experimental design we communicate information on the cognitive ability of both players. We use three stage games: Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) and two versions of Battle of Sexes (BoS), with high and low payoff inequality. We find that the information affects strategic behavior significantly in two distinct ways. 
In PD, disclosure markedly hampers cooperation, as higher intelligence players are less cooperative once they are made aware that they play against someone of lower ability than themselves in the disclosure treatment. Similarly, in BoS with low payoff inequality, disclosure disrupts coordination on outcomes with positive payoffs, as higher intelligence players try to force their most preferred outcome onto the less intelligent. 
However, in BoS with high payoff inequality, this pattern of behavior dramatically changes. Disclosure does not significantly affect coordination rates. Differently from the low payoff inequality game,  coordination is achieved more often on outcomes that favor less intelligent players. We conjecture that when coordination becomes more difficult, because of the high inequality between payoffs, intelligence and inequality together form a coordination device.]]></description><author>Marco Lambrecht, Eugenio Proto, Aldo Rustichini, Andis Sofianos</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16656</guid></item><item><title>Selecting Valuation Distributions: Non-Price Decisions of Multi-Product Firms</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16655</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Armin Schmutzler, Stefanie Bossard.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-21 00:00:00.</b> <p> This paper analyzes decisions of multi-product firms regarding product selection, innovation and advertising as choices of consumer valuation distributions. We show that a profit-maximizing monopolist chooses these distributions so as to maximize the dispersion of the valuation differences between goods across consumers. By contrast, she chooses the willingness-to-pay to be maximally or minimally dispersed, depending on the set of available distributions. In our benchmark model with uniform valuation differences, prices are increasing in valuation difference heterogeneity, but in more general settings this is not necessarily true. Moreover, the relation between willingness-to-pay heterogeneity and prices may well be non-monotone. Over wide parameter ranges, the firm's choice of valuation distribution does not maximize net consumer surplus. This problem is exacerbated when the firm has access to strategies that distort valuation heterogeneity or willingness-to-pay heterogeneity.]]></description><author>Armin Schmutzler, Stefanie Bossard</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16655</guid></item><item><title>Growing Apart: Declining Within- and Across-Locality Insurance in Rural China</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16654</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Orazio Attanasio, Costas Meghir, Corina Mommaerts, Yu Zheng.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-21 00:00:00.</b> <p> We consider risk sharing in rural China during rapid economic transformation from the late 1980s through the late 2000s.

Goodhart.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-20 00:00:00.</b> <p> The post-Corona economic environment puts a premium on finding fiscal means to stimulate the economy while continuing to finance current levels of expenditures and debt. We develop and carefully calibrate a model of the US economy to show that an increase in the tax rate on the value of land, balanced by decreases in the tax rates on the incomes of capital and labor, can meet this need. We find that the US share of land in total nonfinancial assets is more than 50%, so that the tax base is very large. This is corroborated by very high quality OECD data for other industrialized economies that, almost without exception, find land shares of between 40% and 60%. Our baseline proposed tax reform is an increase in the tax rate on the asset value of land from its current 0.55% to 5.55%, accompanied by reductions in tax rates on capital and labor incomes of 28 and 10 percentage points, respectively. In a representative household model, this increases welfare by 3.4% of steady state consumption, and increases output by almost 15% relative to trend. In an economy with separate groups of workers, capitalists and landlords, the output gain is the same, while the welfare gain increases to 6.4% on average across the three groups. Welfare and output gains for a wealth tax that raises the same revenue, and which increases the tax rates on capital and land equally, are only half as large as the baseline. Welfare and output gains for an optimal tax reform, under the assumption that the tax rate on the value of land is capped at 20%, are approximately twice as large as the baseline. This reform raises 55% of all tax revenue through land taxes, with the remaining 45% raised through consumption taxes, while all income taxes are abolished.]]></description><author>Michael Kumhof, Nicolaus Tideman, Michael Hudson, Charles A.

We combine these two scenarios, and show that they interact in deep and interesting ways. The stance of monetary policy has substantial effects on the equilibrium degree of protection in a Nash equilibrium of the monetary and trade policy game. Trade wars lead to higher equilibrium inflation rates. Cooperation in monetary policy leads to both higher inflation and greater degree of trade protection. By contrast, when monetary policy is constrained by pegged exchange rates or the zero lower bound on interest rates, equilibrium tariffs are lower.

We estimate U.S. county level direct and spillover effects of Stay-at-Home-Orders (SHOs) aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 on mobility and social interaction measures. We propose a modified difference-in-difference regression design, based on contiguous-county triplets. This approach compares treated counties, which adopted the SHO, and neighbors, to the neighbor's neighbors, which we term hinterland, counties. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declined by a third to a half as much as in the treated locations. These spillover effects are concentrated in neighbors that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we decompose the spillover decline in mobility into reductions in external visits coming from the treated county and an even stronger voluntary decline in the neighbor county's own traffic. Together, our results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and illustrate the quantitative importance of voluntary social distancing. The finding that the estimated spillovers are in the same direction as the direct effects casts doubt on the prevailing narrative that a more nationally coordinated policy response would have accomplished a greater reduction in mobility and contacts.]]></description><author>Vadim Elenev, Luis Quintero, Alessandro Rebucci, Emilia Simeonova</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16649</guid></item><item><title>Are Housing Prices too Low?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16648</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Andrea Pozzi, Claudio Michelacci.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-19 00:00:00.</b> <p> We propose a sufficient statistic to evaluate whether housing prices are inefficiently low for maximizing steady-state household welfare when housing has collateral value.

We focus on 2 x 2 coordination games, which generate multiple equilibria when perception is precise. When adding a small amount of cognitive imprecision to the model, we obtain a unique equilibrium where players use a simple cutoff strategy. The model further predicts that behavior is context-dependent: players implement the unique equilibrium strategy with noise, and the noise decreases in fundamental volatility. Our experimental data strongly support this novel prediction and reject several alternative game-theoretic models that do not predict context-dependence. We also find that subjects are aware of other players' imprecision, which is key to generating strategic uncertainty.

How many of these newly remote jobs will go overseas? We offer a rough quantification based on two observations: 1) offshore work is trade in services, and 2) the number of telemigrants is the volume of this trade divided by the average wage. Combining these with gravity-model estimates, we can roughly predict the number of new telemigrants that would arise from lower barriers to trade in services. Telemigration seems unlikely to be transformative when it comes to the development paths of most emerging economies. The baseline service trade flows are modest, and the standard gravity model restricts modest changes to have modest impacts. There are no tipping points in structural gravity models. Finally, we propose a simple model of telemigration in which small changes can have large consequences. The key is to assume that latent comparative advantage takes a different shape than typically assumed in quantitative trade models. Given this, small changes in trade costs can generate large and asymmetric increases in the exports of service tasks from low-wage nations.]]></description><author>Richard Baldwin, Jonathan Dingel</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16641</guid></item><item><title>Mental Health Therapy as a Core Strategy for Increasing Human Capital: Evidence from Ghana</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16640</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Nathan Barker, Gharad Bryan, Dean Karlan, Angela Ofori-Atta, Christopher Udry.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-16 00:00:00.</b> <p> We study the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for individuals selected from the general population of poor households in rural Ghana.

We show how a tractable heterogeneous-agent new-Keynesian model with a frictional labor market matches both facts once we include endogenous separations and sluggish vacancy creation. Relative to a model with exogenous separations and free entry, our framework attributes almost twice as large a share of output fluctuations to the inefficient unemployment-risk channel, and thus gives a larger role to stabilization policy.]]></description><author>Tobias Broer, Jeppe Druedahl, Karl Harmenberg, Erik Öberg</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16639</guid></item><item><title>Perceptions and Preferences for Redistribution</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16638</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Stefanie Stantcheva.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-14 00:00:00.</b> <p> The relationship between the degree of inequality and the demand for redistribution has been a central question in political science and political economy. The famous median-voter model predicts that higher inequality, reflected in a growing gap between the income of the average and the median voter, should lead to increased demand for redistribution, as policymakers cater to the median voter's preferences (Meltzer and Richard, 1981). Yet, using data from OECD countries, Kenworthy and McCall (2008) show that, despite increases in inequality in those countries, there was no corresponding increase in demand for redistribution. Part of the explanation of this puzzle lies in the realization that it is not only (or even mainly) reality, but perceptions that shape support for policy. This article will explore recent evidence using large-scale social economics surveys and experiments that sheds lights on beliefs about inequality, social mobility, diversity and immigration, social position, and understanding of how policies work.]]></description><author>Stefanie Stantcheva</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16638</guid></item><item><title>A Mountain of Debt: Navigating the Legacy of the Pandemic</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16637</link><description><![CDATA[<i>M.

This paper examines these trade-offs by putting the recent debt boom into a historical context. It reports three major findings. First, during the 2020 global recession, both global government and private debt levels rose to record highs, and at their fastest single-year pace, in five decades. Second, the debt-financed, massive fiscal support programs implemented during the pandemic supported activity and illustrated the benefits of accumulating debt. However, as the recovery gains traction, the balance of benefits and costs of debt accumulation could increasingly tilt toward costs. Third, more than two-thirds of emerging market and developing economies are currently in government debt booms. On average, the current booms have already lasted three years longer, and are accompanied by a considerably larger fiscal deterioration, than earlier booms. About half of the earlier debt booms were associated with financial crises in emerging market and developing economies.]]></description><author>M.

Yet, little is known which citizenship policies work and who actually benefits from them. To answer these questions, we estimate the marginal returns to citizenship on children's school performance and skill development. For identification, we use two national reforms, which facilitated naturalization for first-generation 
immigrants and introduced birthright citizenship. We find substantial unobserved heterogeneity in returns with reverse selection on gains, i.e., the returns are highest for those with the lowest propensity of take-up. Citizenship significantly improves the school performance of immigrant children but has only modest effects on test scores. Policy simulations indicate that raising citizenship take-up would generate sizable benefits overall.

This positive relation operates through the expected risk premium, rather than the expected risk-free rate or inflation rate. Pension funds act on their beliefs and adjust their portfolio composition accordingly. Persistent investment skills, risk-taking, efforts to reduce costly rebalancing, and fiscal incentives from unfunded liabilities cannot fully explain the reliance of expectations on past performance.

At the end of World War II, a famine occurred abruptly in the Western Netherlands (November 1944 - May 1945), pushing the previously and subsequently well-nourished Dutch population to the brink of starvation. We link high-quality military recruits data with objective health measurements for the cohorts born in the years surrounding WWII with newly digitised historical records on calories and nutrient composition of the war rations, daily temperature, and warfare deaths. Using difference-in-differences and triple differences research designs, we show that the cohorts exposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter since early gestation have a higher Body Mass Index and an increased probability of being overweight at age 18, and that this effect is partly accounted for by warfare exposure and a reduction in energy-adjusted protein intake. Moreover, we account for selective mortality using a copula-based approach and newly-digitised data on survival rates, and find evidence of both selection and scarring effects.

These findings cast doubt on claims that a low-tax, low-regulation capitalism will generate extreme capital accumulation, and that persistent wealth equalization requires large shocks to capital coming from wars or progressive taxation.

As their use varies across products, exports of some products are more resilient than others during times of increased uncertainty.

their long exposures to sovereign risk during this period. Lower loan exposure to
sovereign risk is associated with greater protection selling in CDS, the effect being
weaker when sovereign risk is high. Bank and country risk variables are mostly
not associated with protection selling. The findings are driven by the actions of
a few non-dealer banks which sold CDS protection aggressively at the onset of
the crisis, but started covering their positions at its height while simultaneously
shifting their assets towards sovereign bonds and loans. Our findings underscore

The reform, which included a regressive income tax schedule, was explicitly aimed at attracting the top 1%. Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimations comparing Obwalden to all other cantons confirm that the reform successfully attracted rich taxpayers: by 2016, the share of rich in the canton had more than doubled, and average income per taxpayer was 16% higher relative to 2005. Using individual tax return data, I find a large elasticity of the stock of rich taxpayers of 1.5â??2 with respect to the net-of- average-tax rate. The corresponding flow elasticity is 7.2. To address potential endogeneity, I use a DiD approach to instrument the tax rate changes caused by the reform. Despite the large behavioral responses, the reform did not increase revenue per capita in the canton. Finally, I find small positive effects on local employment. However, rich in-movers were not more likely to also work in the canton, and I cannot rule out that employment effects were driven by the simultaneous reduction in corporate income taxes.]]></description><author>Isabel Z.

We find that in both outlets, men and whites are generally over-represented relative to their population share, while women and Hispanics are under-represented. News content perpetuates common stereotypes such as associating women with narratives about caring roles and family; Blacks and Hispanics with low-skill jobs, crime, and poverty; and Asians with high-skill jobs and science. There are some significant differences across outlets, with Fox's content displaying a stronger association of Hispanics with immigration than the New York Times.

PPP loans were administered by private lenders but federally guaranteed, largely eliminating unobservable credit risk as a factor in explaining differential lending by race. We document that even after controlling for a firm's zip code, industry, loan size, PPP approval date, and other characteristics, Black-owned businesses were 12.1 percentage points (70% of the mean) more likely to obtain their PPP loan from a fintech lender than a traditional bank. Among conventional lenders, smaller banks were much less likely to lend to Black-owned firms, while the Top-4 banks exhibited little to no disparity after including controls. We use novel data to show that the disparity is not primarily explained by differences in pre-existing bank or credit relationships, firm financial positions, fintech affinity, or borrower application behavior. In contrast, we document that Black-owned businesses' higher rate of borrowing from fintechs compared to smaller banks is particularly large in places with high racial animus, pointing to a potential role for discrimination in explaining some of the racial disparities in small business lending. We find evidence that when small banks automate their lending processes, and thus reduce human involvement in the loan origination process, their rate of PPP lending to Black-owned businesses increases, with larger effects in places with more racial animus.]]></description><author>Sabrina Howell, Theresa Kuchler, David Snitkof, Johannes Ströbel, Jun Wong</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16623</guid></item><item><title>What do you think about climate finance?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16622</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Johannes Ströbel, Jeffrey Wurgler.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-08 00:00:00.</b> <p> We survey 861 finance academics, professionals, and public sector regulators and policy economists about climate finance topics.

At the time over 40% of openings on the nation's largest job-board specified a preferred gender.  Over the next year the fraction fell to under 5%. We merge data on filled vacancies to linked employer-employee data to study how the elimination of gender preferences affected hiring and job outcomes. Prior to the campaign, most stated preferences were concordant with the firm's existing gender composition, but a minority targeted the opposite gender - a subset we call non-stereotypical vacancies. Vacancies with a gender preference were very likely (>90%) to be filled by someone of that gender. We use pre-campaign vacancies to predict the probabilities of specifying preferences for females, males, or neither gender. We then conduct event studies of the effect of the campaign on the predicted groups. We find that the elimination of gender preferences led to a rise in the fraction of women hired for jobs likely to be targeted to men (and vice versa), increasing the diversity of hiring workplaces. Partially offsetting this effect, we find a reduction in the success of non-stereotypical vacancies in hiring the targeted gender, and indications of a decline in the efficiency of matching.  For the much larger set of stereotypical vacancies, however, vacancy filling times, wages, and job durations were largely unaffected by the campaign, suggesting that the elimination of stated preferences had at most small consequences on overall job match efficiency.]]></description><author>David Card, Fabrizio Colella, Rafael Lalive</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16619</guid></item><item><title>The Great Covid Cash Surge - Digitalisation Hasn't Dented Cash's Safe Haven Role</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16618</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Jonathan Ashworth, Charles A.

With Full Commitment, optimal fiscal announcements are unbiased forecasts of future taxes. Costly state contingency dampens the response of both current and future capital taxes to government spending shocks, because the government uses announcements about future taxes to stimulate current output. Labor taxes play a major role in accommodating fiscal shocks. This mechanism allows the model to successfully match the empirical volatility of tax rates.
In the absence of Full Commitment, optimal fiscal announcements are strategically biased. Costly state contingency generates an endogenous degree of fiscal commitment, leading to a positive, but low average capital tax---approximately 8% in our calibrated model.]]></description><author>Andrea Lanteri, Alex Clymo, Alessandro Villa</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16616</guid></item><item><title>Global Evidence on Profit Shifting: The Role of Intangible Assets</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16615</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Fotis Delis, Manthos Delis, Luc Laeven, Steven Ongena.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-05 00:00:00.</b> <p> We study global variations in profit shifting and the role played therein by firms' intangible assets.

We highlight that persistence in dividend growth induces a previously overlooked channel for return predictability, which we label "dividend momentum."

Individuals can respond along many margins, such as labor supply, tax avoidance and evasion, and geographic mobility. But one margin that taxes may affect - innovation - is less frequently considered. Conceptually, taxes reduce the expected net returns to innovation inputs and can reduce innovation. Much like other margins of responses to taxes, this efficiency cost must be taken into account. Innovation is done by a relatively small number of people, but it is nevertheless likely to have widespread benefits. While inventors may have divergent motivations, such as social recognition or the love of discovery, they also face an economic reality. How strongly innovation responds to taxes is an empirical question that has been the subject of a growing body of recent work. In this paper, I study how to account for innovation when setting personal income and capital taxation. I distinguish between two cases: one in which the government can set a differentiated tax on inventors and one in which the government is constrained to set the same tax on all agents. I provide a model that flexibly accounts for the spillovers generated by innovation and the non-pecuniary benefits inventors receive from innovation and derive tax formulas expressed in terms of estimable sufficient statistics. The second part of the paper discusses the empirical evidence on the effects of taxes on the quantity, quality, and location of innovation, as well as tax avoidance and income shifting done through innovation.]]></description><author>Stefanie Stantcheva</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16608</guid></item><item><title>Macroprudential Policy during COVID-19: The Role of Policy Space</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16607</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Kristin Forbes, Katharina Bergant.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-04 00:00:00.</b> <p> This paper uses the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to examine how macroprudential frameworks developed over the past decade performed during a period of heightened financial and economic stress. It discusses a new measure of the macroprudential stance that better captures the intensity of different policies across countries and time. Then it shows that macroprudential policy has been used countercyclically-with stances tightened during the 2010's and eased in response to COVID-19 by more than previous risk-off periods. Countries that tightened macroprudential policy more aggressively before COVID, as well as those that eased more during the pandemic, experienced less financial and economic stress. Countries' ability to use macroprudential policy, however, was significantly constrained by the extent of existing "policy space", i.e., by how aggressively policy was tightened before COVID-19. The use of macroprudential tools was not significantly affected by the space available to use other policy tools (such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, FX intervention, and capital flow management measures), and the use of other tools was not significantly affected by the space available to use macroprudential policy. This suggests that although macroprudential tools are being used countercyclically and should therefore help stabilize economies and financial markets, there appears to be an opportunity to better integrate the use of macroprudential tools with other policies in the future.]]></description><author>Kristin Forbes, Katharina Bergant</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16607</guid></item><item><title>Hot Money Inflows and Bank Risk-Taking: Germany from the 1920s to the Great Depression</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16606</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Natacha Postel-Vinay, Stéphanie Collet.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-04 00:00:00.</b> <p> What is the impact of hot capital inflows on bank risk-taking? In an increasingly financially globalised world this question becomes especially relevant. However few authors have examined it in detail empirically, despite repeated crises in Latin America, East Asia and the Eurozone from the 1980s to the 2010s. In this paper, we collect individual bank data on one of history's most striking examples of a "supply push" in foreign funds: the great inflow of capital from the developed world to Germany in the second half of the 1920s. Bank by bank we examine its effects on decisions related to leverage, lending and liquidity. The specificities of the time period â?? the Dawes Plan of 1924 as well as the relative absence of a Too-Big-to-Fail environment, which we document through extensive historiographical analysis â?? allow us to mitigate endogeneity concerns. We develop a three-step approach in which we run panel regressions including only months of falling interest-rate spreads, and apply a two-stage least-squares model in which initial bank size is used as an instrument. In all our models our results tend to converge: while capital inflows did not seem to impact banks' liquidity decisions, their impact on leverage was non-negligeable. This paper's results thus call for extra prudential oversight whenever cross-border banking flows increase significantly.]]></description><author>Natacha Postel-Vinay, Stéphanie Collet</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16606</guid></item><item><title>Women Legislators and Economic Performance</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16605</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Sonia Bhalotra, Thushyanthan Baskaran, Yogesh Uppal.</i> <p> <b>2021-10-04 00:00:00.</b> <p> There has been a phenomenal global increase in the proportion of women in politics

Both genes and environment exert substantial influences on all outcomes. The anticipation of sexual debut and the postponement of motherhood led by the diffusion of the pill are magnified by gene-environment interactions, while the decline in family size and the rise in childlessness associated with female emancipation are attenuated by gene-environment effects. The nature-nurture interplay becomes stronger in more egalitarian environments that empower women, allowing genes to express themselves more fully.

In contrast, service times are shorter in more competitive markets, on low-demand/low-cost days of the week, and for deliveries offered by high-priced grocers. Next, we exploit regional and temporal variation in entry decisions to examine how incumbents respond. We find that incumbents reduce service time when facing entry, but only on low-demand/low-utilization days. This reduction begins shortly before entry and is greater in monopolistic markets and when entrants pose a larger threat to the incumbent. Service time falls also in markets that do not experience entry yet are served by a fulfillment center serving markets facing entry.

We find that trust in scientists is the key driving force behind individual support for and compliance with NPIs, and for favorable attitudes towards vaccination. The effect of trust in government is more ambiguous and tends to diminish support for and compliance with NPIs in countries where the recommendations from scientists and the government were not aligned. Trust in others also has seemingly paradoxical effects: in countries where social trust is high, the support for NPIs is low due to higher expectations that others will voluntary social distance. Our individual-level longitudinal data also allows us to evaluate the effects of within-person changes in trust over the pandemic: we show that trust levels, and in particular trust in scientists, have changed dramatically for individuals and within countries, with important subsequent effects on compliant behavior and support for NPIs.

expected social returns to investing in parallel in multiple approaches to accelerating vaccination. We
argue there are high expected social returns to investigating the scope for lowering the dosage of some
COVID-19 vaccines. While existing evidence is not dispositive, available clinical data on the
immunogenicity of lower doses combined with evidence of a high correlation between neutralizing
antibody response and vaccine efficacy suggests that half- or even quarter-doses of some vaccines could
generate high levels of protection, particularly against severe disease and death, while potentially
expanding supply by 450 million to 1.55 billion doses per month, based on supply projections for 2021. An
epidemiological model suggests that even if fractional doses are less effective than standard doses,
vaccinating more people faster could substantially reduce total infections and deaths. The costs of further
testing alternative doses are much lower than the expected public health and economic benefits.
However, commercial incentives to generate evidence on fractional dosing are weak, suggesting that
testing may not occur without public investment. Governments could support either experimental or
observational evaluations of fractional dosing, for either primary or booster shots. Discussions with
researchers and government officials in multiple countries where vaccines are scarce suggest strong
interest in these approaches.]]></description><author>Witold Więcek, Amrita Ahuja, Esha Chaudhuri, Michael Kremer, Alexandre Simoes Gomes Junior, Christopher Snyder, Alex Tabarrok, Brandon Tan</author><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16599</guid></item><item><title>Exposure, Experience, and Expertise: Why Personal Histories Matter in Economics</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16598</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Ulrike M.

A growing literature on experience effects shows that individuals act as if past outcomes that they experienced were overly likely to occur again, even if they are fully informed about the actual likelihood. This reaction to past experiences is long-lasting though it decays over time as individuals accumulate new experiences. Modern brain science helps understand these processes. Evidence on neuroplasticity reveals that personal experiences and learning alter the strength of neural connections and fine-tune the brain structure to those past experiences ("use-dependent brain"). I show that experience effects help understand belief formation and decision-making in a wide area of economic applications, including inflation, home purchases, mortgage choices, and consumption expenditures.

Contrary to the game-theoretic prediction, both leaders and citizens engage in corruption. Importantly, corruption in the game is correlated with real-world corruption by leaders: citizens send bribes to leaders whom we observe appropriating community money, and these leaders are likely to reciprocate the bribes.

For identification, we exploit the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and merge unique supervisory data from the German credit register on individual bank-firm credit exposures with the security register data that include banks' equity holdings. We find that a large and ex-ante persistent equity position held by a bank in a firm is associated with a larger credit provision from the respective bank to that firm. In crisis times, however, equity stakes only foster credit supply to ex-ante riskier firms especially from relatively weak banks. This ex-ante risk-taking may be due to better (insider) information by the bank, including a traditional lending relationship over the crisis. However, this ex-ante riskier lending translates also into higher ex-post loan defaults, worse firm-level stock market returns and even more firm bankruptcy or restructuring cases. Our results therefore suggest that banks' equity stakes in their borrowers do not mitigate debt overhang problems of distressed firms in crisis times, but rather foster evergreening of banks' outstanding credit to those (zombie) firms.]]></description><author>Falko Fecht, José Luis Peydró, Günseli Tümer-Alkan, Yuejuan Yu</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16594</guid></item><item><title>Local institutions and pandemics: City autonomy and the Black Death</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16593</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Han Wang, Andrés Rodríguez-Pose.</i> <p> <b>2021-09-30 00:00:00.</b> <p> Local institutions have long been regarded as key drivers of economic development. However, little is known about the role of institutions in preparing places to cope with public health crises and pandemics. This paper sheds light on how the nature of a local institution, city autonomy, influenced variations in the incidence of the Black Death -possibly the worst pandemic ever recorded- across cities in Western Europe between 1347 and 1352. We examine urban autonomy not only because it represented a major political shift in medieval times, but because, more importantly, it also represents a key prototype of modern political institutions. By exploiting data on the spatial variation of Black Death's mortality rates and duration using OLS and 2SLS methods, we uncover that city autonomy reduced mortality rates by, on average, almost 10 percent. Autonomous cities were in a better position to adopt swift and efficient measures against the pandemic than those governed by remote kings and emperors. This relationship has been confirmed by a series of placebo tests and robustness checks. In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that city autonomy was a factor in reducing the duration of the pandemic in European cities.]]></description><author>Han Wang, Andrés Rodríguez-Pose</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16593</guid></item><item><title>The Rise of Scientific Research in Corporate America</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16592</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Ashish Arora, Sharon Belenzon, Konstantin Kosenko, Jungkyu Suh, Yishay Yafeh.</i> <p> <b>2021-09-30 00:00:00.</b> <p> Corporate science in America emerged in the interwar period, as some companies set up state-of-the-art corporate laboratories, hired highly skilled scientists, and embarked upon basic research of the kind we would associate today with academic institutions. Using a newly assembled dataset on U.S. companies between 1926 and 1940 combining information on corporate ownership, organization, research and innovation, we attempt to explain the rise of corporate research. We argue that it was driven by companies trying to take advantage of opportunities for innovation made possible by scientific advances and an underdeveloped academic research system in the United States. Measuring field-specific scientific backwardness in several different ways, we find that large firms, business group-affiliated firms, and firms close to the technological frontier were more likely to initiate scientific research. We also find that companies in monopolistic or concentrated industries were more likely to engage in basic research. Corporate research was positively correlated with novel and valuable patents, and with market-to-book ratios. For companies choosing to do so, investment in corporate research seems to have paid off.

This paper investigates a potential explanation that was first proposed by Adam Smith: Larger cities facilitate greater division of labor within firms. Using a dataset of Brazilian firms, I first document that division of labor is indeed robustly correlated with city size, controlling for firm size. To quantify the importance of division of labor in explaining productivity advantages of cities, I propose and estimate a quantitative model that embeds a theory of firms' choice of the optimal division of labor in a spatial equilibrium framework. In the model, the observed positive correlation between firm's division of labor and city size is generated by both a selection effect -firms endogenously sort across space, choosing different extents of division of labor-and a treatment effect-larger cities increase division of labor for all firms, possibly by reducing costs associated with greater division of labor. Structural estimates derived from the model show that division of labor accounts for 17% of the productivity advantage of larger cities in Brazil, half of which is due to firm sorting and the other half to the treatment effect of larger city size. The theory also generates a set of auxiliary predictions of firms' responses to an exogenous shock to division of labor. Exploiting a quasi-experiment - the gradual roll-out of broadband internet infrastructure - I find causal empirical support for these predictions. Finally, the quasi-experiment also provides out-of-sample validation for the structural estimation: The model is successful in predicting the heterogeneous impacts of the new infrastructure across Brazilian cities.]]></description><author>Lin Tian</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16590</guid></item><item><title>Inequality in Mortality between Black and White Americans by Age, Place, and Cause, and in Comparison to Europe, 1990-2018</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16589</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Hannes Schwandt, Janet Currie, Marlies Bär, James Banks, Paola Bertoli, Aline Bütikofer, Sarah Cattan, Beatrice Chao, Claudia Costa, Libertad Gonzalez, Veronica Gremvu, Kristiina Huttunen, René Karadakic, Lucy Kraftman, Sonya Krutikova, Stefano Lombardi, Peter Redler, Carlos Riumallo-Herl, Ana Rodríguez-González, Kjell G Salvanes, Paula Santana, Josselin Thuilliez, Eddy Van Doorslaer, Tom Van Ourti, Joachim Winter, Bram Wouterse, Amelie Wuppermann.</i> <p> <b>2021-09-29 00:00:00.</b> <p> Although there is a large gap between Black and White American life expectancies, the gap fell 48.9% between 1990-2018, mainly due to mortality declines among Black Americans. We examine age-specific mortality trends and racial gaps in life expectancy in rich and poor U.S. areas and with reference to six European countries.

Inequalities in life expectancy are starker in the U.S. than in Europe. In 1990 White Americans and Europeans in rich areas had similar overall life expectancy, while life expectancy for White Americans in poor areas was lower.  But since then even rich White Americans have lost ground relative to Europeans.  Meanwhile, the gap in life expectancy between Black Americans and Europeans decreased by 8.3%. 
Black life expectancy increased more than White life expectancy in all U.S. areas, but improvements in poorer areas had the greatest impact on the racial life expectancy gap. The causes that contributed the most to Black mortality reductions included: Cancer, homicide, HIV, and causes originating in the fetal or infant period. 

Life expectancy for both Black and White Americans plateaued or slightly declined after 2012, but this stalling was most evident among Black Americans even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. If improvements had continued at the 1990-2012 rate, the racial gap in life expectancy would have closed by 2036.  European life expectancy also stalled after 2014.  Still, the comparison with Europe suggests that mortality rates of both Black and White Americans could fall much further across all ages and in both rich and poor areas.]]></description><author>Hannes Schwandt, Janet Currie, Marlies Bär, James Banks, Paola Bertoli, Aline Bütikofer, Sarah Cattan, Beatrice Chao, Claudia Costa, Libertad Gonzalez, Veronica Gremvu, Kristiina Huttunen, René Karadakic, Lucy Kraftman, Sonya Krutikova, Stefano Lombardi, Peter Redler, Carlos Riumallo-Herl, Ana Rodríguez-González, Kjell G Salvanes, Paula Santana, Josselin Thuilliez, Eddy Van Doorslaer, Tom Van Ourti, Joachim Winter, Bram Wouterse, Amelie Wuppermann</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16589</guid></item><item><title>Supply Chain Resilience: Should Policy Promote Diversification or Reshoring?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16588</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Gene M.

Little is known about optimal policy in the face of insecure supply chains. Should governments promote resilience by subsidizing backup sources of input supply? Should they encourage firms to source from closer and presumably safer domestic suppliers? We address these questions in a very simple model of production with a single critical input and with exogenous risks of relationship-specific and country-wide supply disturbances. We follow Matsuyama and Ushchev (2020) in positing a class of preferences that are homothetic with a single aggregator and that obey Marshall's Second Law of Demand. The familiar case of CES preferences is a member of the class, but it imposes restrictions that are important for policy conclusions.We find that, in the CES case, a subsidy for diversification achieves the constrained social optimum and dominates a policy that promotes reshoring or offshoring. When the demand elasticity rises with price, two policy instruments generally are needed to achieve efficient supply chains, private investments in resilience may be socially excessive, and policy that alter incentives to invest at home versus abroad may achieve greater welfare than ones that encourage or discourage diversification.]]></description><author>Gene M.

We then show that there is a strong positive correlation between expenditures and votes, and that overall the magnitude of this relationship has strongly increased since the 1880s, with a peak in the last quarter of the 20th century. We link these transformations to changes in the conduct of campaigns, and to the introduction of new information technologies.

While the U.S. intervention prevented violent extraconstitutional overthrows, it failed to improve Afghan state capacity or to end the war. The Afghan government fell to Taliban insurgents even before the Americans had fully departed. Afghanistan, however, was not the first American intervention that had these three aims. Over the first third of the 20th century, the U.S. intervened regularly across Latin America. We use this historical experience to test whether these earlier interventions produced similar outcomes and extract lessons.

The nonlinear curve is steep when output is above potential (slack is negative) but flat when output is below potential (slack is positive) so that further increases in economic slack have little effect on inflation. This finding is consistent with evidence of downward nominal wage and price rigidity. When inflation is high, the Phillips curve is linear and relatively steep. These results are robust to placing the threshold between the high and low inflation regimes at 2, 3, or 4 percent inflation or for a threshold based on country-specific medians of inflation.

We find that students choose a more gender-stereotypical subject (girls choose more literature and boys choose more math) when they are induced to think about the recommendation of same-gender parents. The effect is driven by girls who expect literature as a recommendation from their mothers and boys who expect math as a recommendation from their fathers.

We hypothesize that employers coerce victims into silence through the threat of a retaliatory firing, and test this theory by estimating whether external shocks that reduce the value of a worker's outside options exacerbate underreporting. Under mild assumptions, a rise in the severity of formal complaints is indicative of increased underreporting. Combining this insight with an objective measure of the quality of charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), we perform two analyses. First, we assess whether workers report sexual harassment more selectively during recessions, when outside labor market options are limited. We estimate the fraction of sexual harassment charges deemed to have merit by the EEOC increases by 0.5-0.7% for each one percentage point increase in a state-industry's monthly unemployment rate. The effect is amplified in industries employing a larger fraction of men and in establishments with a higher share of male managers. Second, we test whether less generous UI benefits create economic incentives for victims of workplace sexual harassment to remain silent.

First, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 and policy responses on small and medium sized enterprise (SME) business failures. We combine firm-level financial data from 50 sectors in 27 countries, a detailed I-O network, real-time data on lockdown policies and mobility patterns, and a rich model of firm behavior that allows for several dimensions of heterogeneity. We find: (a) Absent government support, the failure rate of SMEs would have increased by 9 percentage points, significantly more so in emerging market economies (EMs). With policy support it only increased by 4.3 per-centage points, and even decreased in advanced economies (AEs). (b) Fiscal policy was poorly targeted: most of the funds disbursed went to firms who did not need it. (c) Nev-ertheless, we find little evidence of the policy merely postponing mass business failures or creating many 'zombie' firms: failure rates rise only slightly in 2021 once policy support is removed. Next, we build a tractable global intertemporal general equilibrium I-O model with fiscal policy. We calibrate the model to 64 countries and 36 sectors. We find that: (d) a sizeable share of the global economy is demand-constrained under COVID-19, especially so in EMs. (e) Globally, fiscal policy helped offset about 8% of the downturn in COVID, with a low 'traditional' fiscal multiplier. Yet it significantly reduced the share of demand-constrained sectors, preserving employment in these sectors. (f) Fiscal policy exerted small and negative spillovers to output in other countries but positive spillovers on employment.(g) A two-speed recovery would put significant upwards pressure on global interest rates which imposes an additional headwind on the EM recovery. (h) Corporate and sovereign spreads rise when global rates increase, suggesting that EM may face challenging external funding conditions as AEs economies normalize.]]></description><author>Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, Veronika Penciakova, Nick Sander</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16576</guid></item><item><title>Art in Times of Crisis</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16575</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Géraldine David, Yuexin Li, Kim Oosterlinck, Luc Renneboog.</i> <p> <b>2021-09-23 00:00:00.</b> <p> Art is often presented as an investment of last resort or a potential safe haven in times of political or financial distress. Yet, as no study has focused on the performance of art markets in times of crisis, this paper fills this gap by means of unclosing historical auction archives. We trace the long-term performance of the UK art market, which we relate to periods of crisis such as the World Wars, economic recessions, inflationary periods, and changes in monetary policy. By constructing an art price index from 1908 to 2016, we show that the value of British art expanded more than seven-fold over this century. We classify crises into economic & financial crises, systemic ones, and war periods. The results show that art outperformed equities and other financial assets in war times, which implies that it could serve as a hedge against political uncertainties. However, in times of economic and financial crises the art market underperformed the equity market. We also detail changes in art preferences for specific paintings' sizes, art schools, art objects' liquidity, art (price) segments, and art(ist)'s nationality across crises]]></description><author>Géraldine David, Yuexin Li, Kim Oosterlinck, Luc Renneboog</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16575</guid></item><item><title>Consumer Search and Prices in the Automobile Market</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16574</link><description><![CDATA[<i>José-Luis Moraga-González, Zsolt Sándor, Matthijs Wildenbeest.</i> <p> <b>2021-09-22 00:00:00.</b> <p> This paper develops a discrete choice model of demand with optimal sequential consumer search. Consumers first choose a product to search; then, once they learn the utility they get from the searched product, they choose whether to buy it or to keep searching. We characterize the search problem as a standard discrete choice problem and propose a parametric search cost distribution that generates closed-form expressions for the probability of purchasing a product. We propose a method to estimate the model that supplements aggregate product data with individual-specific data which allows for the separate identification of search costs and preferences. We estimate the model using data from the automobile industry and find that search costs have non-trivial implications for elasticities and markups. We study the effects of exclusive dealing regulation and find that firms benefit at the expense of consumers, who face higher search costs and higher prices than would be the case if multi-brand dealerships were used.]]></description><author>José-Luis Moraga-González, Zsolt Sándor, Matthijs Wildenbeest</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16574</guid></item><item><title>Big Loans to Small Businesses: Predicting Winners and Losers in an Entrepreneurial Lending Experiment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16573</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Gharad Bryan, Dean Karlan, Adam Osman.</i> <p> <b>2021-09-22 00:00:00.</b> <p> We experimentally study the impact of substantially larger enterprise loans, in collaboration with an Egyptian lender. Larger loans generate small average impacts, but machine learning using psychometric data reveals dramatic heterogeneity. Top-performers (i.e., those with the highest predicted treatment effects) substantially increase profits, whereas profits for poor-performers drop. The magnitude of this difference implies that an individual lender's credit allocation choices matter for aggregate income. Evidence on two fronts suggests large loans would be misallocated: top-performers are predicted by loan officers to have higher default rates; and, top-performers grow less than others when given small loans, implying that allocating larger loans based on prior performance is not efficient. Our results have important implications for credit expansion policy and our understanding of entrepreneurial talent: on the former, the use of psychometric data to identify top-performers suggests a pathway towards better allocation that revolves around entrepreneurial type more than firm type; on the latter, the reversal of fortune for poor-performers, who do well with small loans but not large, indicates a type of entrepreneur that we call a "go-getter" who performs well when constrained but poorly when not.]]></description><author>Gharad Bryan, Dean Karlan, Adam Osman</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16573</guid></item><item><title>The Rise of the Educated Class</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16572</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Joseph Zeira.</i> <p> <b>2021-09-22 00:00:00.</b> <p> Recent decades have seen dramatic developments in Western countries, which happened in a number of areas, political, economic and social.

Imperfect substitution between inputs allows for general equilibrium effects. We consider any type of cross-base responses to tax changes such as income-shifting. Formalizing the tax schedule as the sum of many one-dimensional schedules, we express optimal marginal tax rate on any kind of income in terms of sufficient statistics, including new ones for cross-base responses and general equilibrium effects. We also identify the conditions under which making the personal income tax marginally more schedular is socially desirable. The comprehensive and schedular (dual, in particular) income taxes being recurring proposals in the public debate, we derive sufficient conditions under which each form of tax is optimal. We stress how empirically restrictive these conditions are. Using a new algorithm on French tax return data, we characterize the optimal combination of a nonlinear tax schedule on personal income and a linear tax rate on capital income. We find that one should include, without any deduction, all income sources in the personal income base and subsidize the source of income which is more elastic. We find that crossbase responses have little effects on the personal nonlinear income tax schedule but increases by 5.9 to 6.9 percentage points the capital tax rate. General equilibrium effects also increases this tax rate by around 4.5 percentage points.]]></description><author>Laurence Jacquet, Etienne Lehmann</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16571</guid></item><item><title>Barriers to Creative Destruction: Large Firms and Non-Productive Strategies</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16570</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Salomé Baslandze.</i> <p> <b>2021-09-21 00:00:00.</b> <p> This chapter reviews recent empirical evidence on large firms and non-productive

hypothesis from social psychology, traditional herding practices
are believed to have generated a value system that is conducive to
revenge-taking and violence. We test this idea at a global scale using
a combination of ethnographic records, historical folklore information,
global data on contemporary conflict events, and large-scale surveys.
The data show systematic links between traditional herding practices
and a culture of honor. First, the culture of pre-industrial societies
that relied on animal herding emphasizes violence, punishment, and
revenge-taking. Second, contemporary ethnolinguistic groups that
historically subsisted more strongly on herding have more frequent
and severe conflict today. Third, the contemporary descendants of
herders report being more willing to take revenge and punish unfair
behavior in the globally representative Global Preferences Survey.
In all, the evidence supports the idea that this form of economic
subsistence generated a functional psychology that has persisted until
today and plays a role in shaping conflict across the globe.]]></description><author>Yiming Cao, Benjamin Enke, Armin Falk, Paola Giuliano, Nathan Nunn</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16569</guid></item><item><title>Less School (Costs), More (Female) Education?

In a randomized control trial that varies the salience of female and minority representation on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee, the FOMC, we test whether diversity affects how Fed information influences consumers' subjective beliefs. Women and Black respondents form unemployment expectations more in line with FOMC forecasts and trust the Fed more after this intervention. Women are also more likely to acquire Fed-related information when associated with a female official. White men, who are overrepresented on the FOMC,  do not react negatively.

Conflicts of interest between these two groups may give rise to pandering in policymaking. We expand the standard pandering setup in two directions. First,  we allow for policies to differ in their complexity. Second, we model the dynamic consequences of reforms, where a complex (simple) policy complexifies (simplifies) the legislative environment in which subsequent policies are drafted. We show that pandering motivates inefficient complex policies, which beget complexity in the legislative environment. We derive conditions under which the complexity build-up is bounded. Stabilization around an intermediate level of complexity is achieved under high uncertainty around the type of policy reform suited to current conditions and around the bureaucracy's capacity to implement it. When complex reforms are expected to be the right ones but bureaucratic capacity is uncertain, the legislative environment may enter a trap of ever increasing complexity.]]></description><author>Massimo Morelli, Dana Foarta</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16562</guid></item><item><title>A Commitment Theory of Populism</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16051-2</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Massimo Morelli, Antonio Nicolò, Paolo Roberti.</i> <p> <b>2021-12-08 00:00:00.</b> <p> When voters' trust in politicians collapses, they demand simple policies that they can easily monitor.
