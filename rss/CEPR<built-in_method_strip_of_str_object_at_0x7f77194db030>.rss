In this setting, it is optimal to run the economy hot during the temporary supply contraction. This result follows from an intertemporal breakdown of the "divine coincidence" of monetary policy:  a positive output gap during the low-supply phase shrinks the negative output gap that is expected to emerge once aggregate supply recovers and the ZLB binds. However, our analysis does not suggest that monetary policy should remain loose throughout the low-supply phase. Since aggregate demand has inertia, the central bank should frontload interest rate cuts and then quickly normalize the interest rate once it succeeds in building aggregate demand momentum.]]></description><author>Ricardo Caballero Alp Simsek</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16814</guid></item></channel></rss>
