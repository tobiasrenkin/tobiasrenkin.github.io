This effect is particularly pronounced for banks with large prior fossil-lending exposures, while bank capital and profitability do not play a role. In addition, banks reallocate a relatively larger share of their fossil loan portfolio to countries without a carbon tax. Our findings speak to the importance of a global carbon tax to prevent the reallocation of carbon emissions across national borders via financial markets.]]></description><author>Alexander Popov Luc Laeven</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16745</guid></item></channel></rss>
