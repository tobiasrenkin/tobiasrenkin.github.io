Exploiting exogenous variation in the timing of vaccinations, we find that vaccination increases psychological well-being by 0.12 standard deviation, compensating for around one half of the overall decrease caused by the pandemic. This effect persists for at least two months, and it is associated with a decrease in the perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and higher engagement in social activities. The improvement is 1.5 times larger for mentally distressed individuals, supporting the prioritization of this group in vaccination roll-outs.]]></description><author>Bagues, Manuel &amp; Dimitrova, Velichka</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16694</guid></item><item><title>Urban Public Works in Spatial Equilibrium: Experimental Evidence from Ethiopia</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16691</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> This paper evaluates Ethiopia's Urban Productive Safety Net Program, which provides employment on local public works to the urban poor, and was rolled out randomly across neighborhoods of Addis Ababa.  We find that the program increased public employment and reduced private labor supply among beneficiaries. We also show that it improved local amenities in treated locations, for both beneficiary and non-beneficiaries. We then develop a spatial equilibrium model and leverage unique data on commuting flows to quantify the effect of exposure to changes in labor supply from treated locations on labor markets across the city. Our estimates imply that once fully rolled out the program increased private wages by 18.6%. Finally, we use the model to compute the welfare gains to the poor: when we include the indirect effects on private wages and local amenities the welfare gains are four times larger than the direct benefits from public employment alone.]]></description><author>Abebe, Girum &amp; Franklin, Simon &amp; Imbert, Clément &amp; Mejia-Mantilla, Carolina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16691</guid></item><item><title>On the Persistence of the China Shock</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16688</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> We evaluate the duration of the China trade shock and its impact on a wide range of outcomes over the period 2000 to 2019. The shock plateaued in 2010, enabling analysis of its effects for nearly a decade past its culmination. Adverse impacts of import competition on manufacturing employment, overall employment-population ratios, and income per capita in more trade-exposed U.S. commuting zones are present out to 2019. Over the full study period, greater import competition implies a reduction in the manufacturing employment-population ratio of 1.54 percentage points, which is 55% of the observed change in the value, and the absorption of 86% of this net job loss via a corresponding decrease in the overall employment rate. Reductions in population headcounts, which indicate net out-migration, register only for foreign-born workers and the native-born 25-39 years old, implying that exit from work is a primary means of adjustment to trade-induced contractions in labor demand. More negatively affected regions see modest increases in the uptake of government transfers, but these transfers primarily take the form of Social Security and Medicare benefits. Adverse outcomes are more acute in regions that initially had fewer college-educated workers and were more industrially specialized. Impacts are qualitatively-but not quantitatively-similar to those caused by the decline of employment in coal production since the 1980s, indicating that the China trade shock holds lessons for other episodes of localized job loss. Import competition from China induced changes in income per capita across local labor markets that are much larger than the spatial heterogeneity of income effects predicted by standard quantitative trade models. Even using higher-end estimates of the consumer benefits of rising trade with China, a substantial fraction of commuting zones appears to have suffered absolute declines in average real incomes.]]></description><author>Autor, David &amp; Dorn, David &amp; Hanson, Gordon</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16688</guid></item><item><title>Women in Economics: Europe and the World</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16686</link><description><![CDATA[<b>November 2021</b> <p> Based on a data set that we collected from the top research institutions in
economics around the globe (including universities, business schools and other organizations
such as central banks), we document the underrepresentation of women
in economics. For the 238 universities and business schools in the sample, women
hold 25% of senior level positions (full professor, associate professor) and 37% of
junior level positions. In the 82 U.S. universities and business schools, the figures
are 20% on the senior level and 32% on the entry level, while in the 122 European
institutions, the numbers are 27% and 38%, respectively, with some heterogeneity
across countries. The numbers also show that the highest-ranking institutions (in
terms of research output) have fewer women in senior positions. Moreover, in the
U.S., this effect is even present on the junior level. The "leaky pipeline" may hence
begin earlier than oftentimes assumed, and is even more of an issue in the highly
integrated market of the U.S. In Europe, an institution ranked 100 places higher
has three percentage points fewer women in senior positions, but in the U.S. it is
almost 5 percentage points.]]></description><author>Auriol, Emmanuelle &amp; Friebel, Guido &amp; Weinberger, Alisa &amp; Wilhelm, Sascha</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16686</guid></item><item><title>Understanding the role of firms in the gender wage gap over time, over the life cycle, and across worker types</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16671</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Evidence across many jurisdictions suggests that firm pay premiums contribute meaningfully to the gender wage gap and that this is largely driven by sorting of women into lower paying firms rather than within firm gender differences in pay premiums. We build on this evidence using a cluster-based approach which allows us to relax the usual sample restrictions, to use repeated 2 year panels to examine how the contribution of firms to the gender wage gap has changed over time, to compute age-specific estimates of the gender gap in firm pay premium to document changes over the life cycle, and to explore whether there are complementarities between worker types and firm effects and how these differ by gender. We show that lifting the dual connected set restriction reveals a slightly larger contribution of firms to the gender wage gap, and more strikingly a higher within firm component. Further, the gender gap in firm pay premiums remained fairly constant between 1995 and 2015 (as did the decomposition of this gap) but represents an increasing share of the overall gender wage gap over time. It increases with age, exclusively driven by an increase of the sorting of women into lower paying firms. Finally we find limited evidence of complementarities for both men and women.]]></description><author>Palladino, Marco Guido &amp; Roulet, Alexandra &amp; Stabile, Mark</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16671</guid></item><item><title>The Fiscal and Welfare Effects of Policy Responses to the Covid-19 School Closures</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16663</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Using a structural life-cycle model and data on school visits from Safegraph and school
closures from Burbio, we quantify the heterogeneous impact of school closures during the
Corona crisis on children affected at different ages and coming from households with different
parental characteristics. Our data suggests that secondary schools were closed for
in-person learning for longer periods than elementary schools (implying that younger children
experienced less school closures than older children), and that private schools experienced
shorter closures than public schools, and schools in poorer U.S. counties experienced
shorter school closures. We then extend the structural life cycle model of private and
public schooling investments studied in Fuchs-SchÃ¼ndeln, Krueger, Ludwig, and Popova
(2021) to include the choice of parents whether to send their children to private schools,
empirically discipline it with data on parental investments from the PSID, and then feed
into the model the school closure measures from our empirical analysis to quantify the
long-run consequences of the Covid-19 school closures on the cohorts of children currently
in school. Future earnings- and welfare losses are largest for children that started public
secondary schools at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. Comparing children from the top to
children from the bottom quartile of the income distribution, welfare losses are ca. 0.8
percentage points larger for the poorer children if school closures were unrelated to income.
Accounting for the longer school closures in richer counties reduces this gap by about 1/3.
A policy intervention that extends schools by 3 months (6 weeks in the next two summers)
generates significant welfare gains for the children and raises future tax revenues approximately
sufficient to pay for the cost of this schooling expansion.]]></description><author>Fuchs-Schündeln, Nicola &amp; Krueger, Dirk &amp; Kurmann, Andre &amp; Lale, Etienne &amp; Ludwig, Alexander &amp; Popova, Irina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16663</guid></item><item><title>How Do Acquisitions Affect the Mental Health of Employees?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16657</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Using employer-employee level data linked to individual health records, we document that the incidence of stress, anxiety, depression, psychiatric medication usage, and even suicide increase following acquisitions. These effects are prevalent among employees from both targets and acquirers, in weak as well as in growing, profitable firms. Employees who experience negative career developments within the merging firms, 'blue-collar' workers, and employees with lower cognitive and non-cognitive skills are most affected. A variety of tests address endogeneity concerns, including an analysis exploiting failed mergers. Our findings point to mental illness as a significant non-pecuniary cost of acquisitions.]]></description><author>Bach, Laurent &amp; Baghai, Ramin P. &amp; Bos, Marieke &amp; Silva, Rui C</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16657</guid></item><item><title>Intelligence Disclosure and Cooperation in Repeated Interactions</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16656</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We investigate in a laboratory setting whether revealing information on intelligence affects behavior in games with repeated interactions. In our experimental design we communicate information on the cognitive ability of both players. We use three stage games: Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) and two versions of Battle of Sexes (BoS), with high and low payoff inequality. We find that the information affects strategic behavior significantly in two distinct ways. 
In PD, disclosure markedly hampers cooperation, as higher intelligence players are less cooperative once they are made aware that they play against someone of lower ability than themselves in the disclosure treatment. Similarly, in BoS with low payoff inequality, disclosure disrupts coordination on outcomes with positive payoffs, as higher intelligence players try to force their most preferred outcome onto the less intelligent. 
However, in BoS with high payoff inequality, this pattern of behavior dramatically changes. Disclosure does not significantly affect coordination rates. Differently from the low payoff inequality game,  coordination is achieved more often on outcomes that favor less intelligent players. We conjecture that when coordination becomes more difficult, because of the high inequality between payoffs, intelligence and inequality together form a coordination device.]]></description><author>Lambrecht, Marco &amp; Proto, Eugenio &amp; Rustichini, Aldo &amp; Sofianos, Andis</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16656</guid></item><item><title>The Geography of Job Creation and Job Destruction</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16645</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Spatial differences in labor market performance are large and highly persistent. Using data from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we document striking similarities in spatial differences in unemployment, vacancies, job finding, and job filling within each country. This robust set of facts guides and disciplines the development of a theory of local labor market performance. We find that a spatial version of a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model with endogenous separations and on-the-job search quantitatively accounts for all the documented empirical regularities. The model also quantitatively rationalizes why differences in job-separation rates have primary importance in
inducing differences in unemployment across space while changes in the job-finding rate are the main driver in unemployment fluctuations over the business cycle.]]></description><author>Kuhn, Moritz &amp; Manovskii, Iourii &amp; Qiu, Xincheng</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16645</guid></item><item><title>Mental Health Therapy as a Core Strategy for Increasing Human Capital: Evidence from Ghana</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16640</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We study the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for individuals selected from the general population of poor households in rural Ghana. Results from 2-3 months after a randomized intervention show strong impacts on mental and physical health, cognitive and socioemotional skills, and downstream economic outcomes. We find no evidence of heterogeneity by baseline mental distress; we
argue that this is because CBT can improve human capital for a general population of poor individuals through two pathways. First, CBT reduces vulnerability to deteriorating mental health; and second, CBT directly improves bandwidth, increasing cognitive and socioemotional skills and hence economic outcomes.]]></description><author>Barker, Nathan &amp; Bryan, Gharad &amp; Karlan, Dean S. &amp; Ofori-Atta, Angela &amp; Udry, Christopher</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16640</guid></item><item><title>Marginal Returns to Citizenship and Educational Performance</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16636</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Citizenship is the most important right a host country can bestow on its immigrant population. Yet, little is known which citizenship policies work and who actually benefits from them. To answer these questions, we estimate the marginal returns to citizenship on children's school performance and skill development. For identification, we use two national reforms, which facilitated naturalization for first-generation 
immigrants and introduced birthright citizenship. We find substantial unobserved heterogeneity in returns with reverse selection on gains, i.e., the returns are highest for those with the lowest propensity of take-up. Citizenship significantly improves the school performance of immigrant children but has only modest effects on test scores. Policy simulations indicate that raising citizenship take-up would generate sizable benefits overall. Based on marginal treatment response functions, we also show that expanding birthright citizenship carries higher returns than facilitating naturalization.]]></description><author>Busse, Anna &amp; Gathmann, Christina &amp; Kim, Jongoh &amp; Vonnahme, Christina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16636</guid></item><item><title>Religious practice and student performance: Evidence from Ramadan fasting</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16620</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We investigate how the intensity of Ramadan affects educational outcomes by exploiting spatio-temporal variation in annual fasting hours. Longer fasting hours are related to increases in student performance in a panel of TIMMS test scores (1995-2019) across Muslim countries but not other countries. Results are confirmed in a panel of PISA test scores (2003-2018) allowing within country-wave comparisons of Muslim to non-Muslim students across Europe. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that a demanding Ramadan during  adolescence affects educational performance by facilitating formation of social capital and social identity via increased religious participation and shared experiences among students.]]></description><author>Hornung, Erik &amp; Schwerdt, Guido &amp; Strazzeri, Maurizio</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16620</guid></item><item><title>Gender Preferences in Job Vacancies and Workplace Gender Diversity</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16619</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> In spring 2005, Austria launched a campaign to inform employers and newspapers that gender preferences in job advertisements were illegal. At the time over 40% of openings on the nation's largest job-board specified a preferred gender.  Over the next year the fraction fell to under 5%. We merge data on filled vacancies to linked employer-employee data to study how the elimination of gender preferences affected hiring and job outcomes. Prior to the campaign, most stated preferences were concordant with the firm's existing gender composition, but a minority targeted the opposite gender - a subset we call non-stereotypical vacancies. Vacancies with a gender preference were very likely (>90%) to be filled by someone of that gender. We use pre-campaign vacancies to predict the probabilities of specifying preferences for females, males, or neither gender. We then conduct event studies of the effect of the campaign on the predicted groups. We find that the elimination of gender preferences led to a rise in the fraction of women hired for jobs likely to be targeted to men (and vice versa), increasing the diversity of hiring workplaces. Partially offsetting this effect, we find a reduction in the success of non-stereotypical vacancies in hiring the targeted gender, and indications of a decline in the efficiency of matching.  For the much larger set of stereotypical vacancies, however, vacancy filling times, wages, and job durations were largely unaffected by the campaign, suggesting that the elimination of stated preferences had at most small consequences on overall job match efficiency.]]></description><author>Card, David &amp; Colella, Fabrizio &amp; Lalive, Rafael</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16619</guid></item><item><title>Gene-Environment Effects on Female Fertility</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16603</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Fertility has a strong biological component generally ignored by economists. Using the UK Biobank, we analyze the extent to which genes, proxied by polygenic scores, and the environment, proxied by early exposure to the contraceptive pill diffusion, affect age at first sexual intercourse, age at first birth, completed family size, and childlessness. Both genes and environment exert substantial influences on all outcomes. The anticipation of sexual debut and the postponement of motherhood led by the diffusion of the pill are magnified by gene-environment interactions, while the decline in family size and the rise in childlessness associated with female emancipation are attenuated by gene-environment effects. The nature-nurture interplay becomes stronger in more egalitarian environments that empower women, allowing genes to express themselves more fully. These conclusions are confirmed by heterogenous effects across the distributions of genetic susceptibilities and exposure to environmental risks, sister fixed effects models, mother-daughter comparisons, and counterfactual simulations.]]></description><author>Barban, Nicola &amp; De Cao, Elisabetta &amp; Francesconi, Marco</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16603</guid></item><item><title>The Insurance Role of the Family</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16591</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Besides love and affection the family also provides economic benefits. Beyond gains from specialization and economies of scale, it serves as a provider of insurance against various risks individuals face throughout their life. This insurance role of the family has changed during past decades owing to several factors: a fundamental transition in the gender wage gap and female labor force participation, the legal framework, and the dynamics of household formation over the life cycle.

We examine age-specific mortality trends and racial gaps in life expectancy in rich and poor U.S. areas and with reference to six European countries.

Inequalities in life expectancy are starker in the U.S. than in Europe. In 1990 White Americans and Europeans in rich areas had similar overall life expectancy, while life expectancy for White Americans in poor areas was lower.  But since then even rich White Americans have lost ground relative to Europeans.  Meanwhile, the gap in life expectancy between Black Americans and Europeans decreased by 8.3%. 
Black life expectancy increased more than White life expectancy in all U.S. areas, but improvements in poorer areas had the greatest impact on the racial life expectancy gap. The causes that contributed the most to Black mortality reductions included: Cancer, homicide, HIV, and causes originating in the fetal or infant period. 

Life expectancy for both Black and White Americans plateaued or slightly declined after 2012, but this stalling was most evident among Black Americans even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. If improvements had continued at the 1990-2012 rate, the racial gap in life expectancy would have closed by 2036.  European life expectancy also stalled after 2014.  Still, the comparison with Europe suggests that mortality rates of both Black and White Americans could fall much further across all ages and in both rich and poor areas.]]></description><author>Banks, James &amp; Bär, Marlies &amp; Bertoli, Paola &amp; Bütikofer, Aline &amp; Cattan, Sarah &amp; Chao, Beatrice &amp; Costa, Claudia &amp; Currie, Janet &amp; Gonzalez, Libertad &amp; Gremvu, Veronica &amp; Huttunen, Kristiina &amp; Karadakic, René &amp; Kraftman, Lucy &amp; Krutikova, Sonya &amp; Lombardi, Stefano &amp; Redler, Peter &amp; Riumallo-Herl, Carlos &amp; Rodríguez-González, Ana &amp; Salvanes, Kjell G &amp; Santana, Paula &amp; Schwandt, Hannes &amp; Thuilliez, Josselin &amp; Van Doorslaer, Eddy &amp; Van Ourti, Tom &amp; Winter, Joachim &amp; Wouterse, Bram &amp; Wuppermann, Amelie</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16589</guid></item><item><title>Parents and Peers: Gender Stereotypes in the Field of Study</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16582</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Gender segregation in the field of study is still a pervasive phenomenon in many countries. In this paper, we highlight the crucial role of parents and peers in adolescents' decision making on their educational choices, leading to a mismatch of talents. We design a lab-in-the-field experiment that exposes 2,500 middle school students in Italy to different information treatments before they choose between a female-typed task (literature) and a male-typed task (math). We find that students choose a more gender-stereotypical subject (girls choose more literature and boys choose more math) when they are induced to think about the recommendation of same-gender parents. The effect is driven by girls who expect literature as a recommendation from their mothers and boys who expect math as a recommendation from their fathers. The field choice of male and female students is not affected when they expect their peers to observe their decision. However, we show
that girls shy away from math to avoid interactions in male-dominated contexts.]]></description><author>Carlana, Michela &amp; Corno, Lucia</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16582</guid></item><item><title>Why is Workplace Sexual Harassment Underreported?

We hypothesize that employers coerce victims into silence through the threat of a retaliatory firing, and test this theory by estimating whether external shocks that reduce the value of a worker's outside options exacerbate underreporting. Under mild assumptions, a rise in the severity of formal complaints is indicative of increased underreporting. Combining this insight with an objective measure of the quality of charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), we perform two analyses. First, we assess whether workers report sexual harassment more selectively during recessions, when outside labor market options are limited. We estimate the fraction of sexual harassment charges deemed to have merit by the EEOC increases by 0.5-0.7% for each one percentage point increase in a state-industry's monthly unemployment rate. The effect is amplified in industries employing a larger fraction of men and in establishments with a higher share of male managers. Second, we test whether less generous UI benefits create economic incentives for victims of workplace sexual harassment to remain silent. We find the selectivity of sexual harassment charges increases by more than 30% in response to a 50% cut to North Carolina's Unemployment Insurance (UI) program following the Great Recession.]]></description><author>Dahl, Gordon &amp; Knepper, Matthew</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16577</guid></item><item><title>Big Loans to Small Businesses: Predicting Winners and Losers in an Entrepreneurial Lending Experiment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16573</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We experimentally study the impact of substantially larger enterprise loans, in collaboration with an Egyptian lender. Larger loans generate small average impacts, but machine learning using psychometric data reveals dramatic heterogeneity. Top-performers (i.e., those with the highest predicted treatment effects) substantially increase profits, whereas profits for poor-performers drop. The magnitude of this difference implies that an individual lender's credit allocation choices matter for aggregate income. Evidence on two fronts suggests large loans would be misallocated: top-performers are predicted by loan officers to have higher default rates; and, top-performers grow less than others when given small loans, implying that allocating larger loans based on prior performance is not efficient. Our results have important implications for credit expansion policy and our understanding of entrepreneurial talent: on the former, the use of psychometric data to identify top-performers suggests a pathway towards better allocation that revolves around entrepreneurial type more than firm type; on the latter, the reversal of fortune for poor-performers, who do well with small loans but not large, indicates a type of entrepreneur that we call a "go-getter" who performs well when constrained but poorly when not.]]></description><author>Bryan, Gharad &amp; Karlan, Dean S. &amp; Osman, Adam</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16573</guid></item><item><title>Herding, Warfare, and A Culture of Honor: Global Evidence</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16569</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> According to the widely known 'culture of honor'
hypothesis from social psychology, traditional herding practices
are believed to have generated a value system that is conducive to
revenge-taking and violence. We test this idea at a global scale using
a combination of ethnographic records, historical folklore information,
global data on contemporary conflict events, and large-scale surveys.
The data show systematic links between traditional herding practices
and a culture of honor. First, the culture of pre-industrial societies
that relied on animal herding emphasizes violence, punishment, and
revenge-taking. Second, contemporary ethnolinguistic groups that
historically subsisted more strongly on herding have more frequent
and severe conflict today. Third, the contemporary descendants of
herders report being more willing to take revenge and punish unfair
behavior in the globally representative Global Preferences Survey.
In all, the evidence supports the idea that this form of economic
subsistence generated a functional psychology that has persisted until
today and plays a role in shaping conflict across the globe.]]></description><author>Cao, Yiming &amp; Enke, Benjamin &amp; Falk, Armin &amp; Giuliano, Paola &amp; Nunn, Nathan</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16569</guid></item><item><title>Less School (Costs), More (Female) Education?

Using administrative data from Germany, we apply an event study design in combination with propensity score matching and a reweighting technique to directly compare men and women who are displaced from similar jobs and firms. Our results show that after a mass layoff, women's earnings losses are about 35% higher than men's, with the gap persisting five years after job displacement. This is partly explained by a higher propensity of women to take up part-time or marginal employment following job loss, but even full-time wage losses are almost 50% (or 5 percentage points) higher for women than for men. We then show that on the household level there is no evidence of an added worker effect, independent of the gender of the job loser. Finally, we document that parenthood magnifies the gender gap sharply: while fathers of young children have smaller earnings losses than men in general, mothers of young children have much larger earnings losses than other women.]]></description><author>Illing, Hannah &amp; Schmieder, Johannes &amp; Trenkle, Simon</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16551</guid></item><item><title>Student Employment and Education: A Meta-Analysis</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16550</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Educational outcomes have many determinants, but one that most young people can readily control is choosing whether to work while in school. Sixty-nine studies have estimated the effect, but results vary from large negative to positive estimates. We show that the results are systematically driven by context, publication bias, and treatment of endogeneity. Studies ignoring endogeneity suffer from an upward bias, which is almost fully compensated by publication selection in favor of negative estimates. Net of the biases, the literature suggests a negative but economically inconsequential mean effect. The effect is more negative for high-intensity employment and educational outcomes measured as decisions to dropout, but it is positive in Germany. To derive these results we collect 861 previously reported estimates together with 32 variables reflecting estimation context, use recently developed nonlinear techniques to correct for publication bias, and employ Bayesian and frequentist model averaging to assign a pattern to the heterogeneity in the literature.]]></description><author>Havranek, Tomas &amp; Irsova, Zuzana &amp; Kroupova, Katerina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16550</guid></item><item><title>Monetary Policy, Labor Income Redistribution and the Credit Channel: Evidence from Matched Employer-Employee and Credit Registers</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16549</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> This paper documents the redistributive effects of monetary policy on labor market outcomes via
the credit channel. For identification, we exploit matched administrative datasets in Portugal
- employee-employer and credit registers - and monetary policy since the Eurozone creation
in 1999. We find that softer monetary policy improves worker labor market outcomes (wages,
hours worked and firm employment) more in small and young firms, which are more financially
constrained. Within small and young firms, the wage effects accrue to incumbent workers,
in line with the back-loaded wage mechanism. Consistent with the capital-skill complementarity
mechanism, we document an increase in skill premium and show that financially constrained
firms increase both physical and human capital investment by most. Our findings uncover
a central role for both the firm-balance sheet and the bank lending channels of the monetary
policy transmission to labor income inequality, with state-dependent effects that are substantially
stronger during crisis times. Importantly, we do not find any redistributive effects for firms
without bank credit.]]></description><author>Jasova, Martina &amp; Mendicino, Caterina &amp; Panetti, Ettore &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Supera, Dominik</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16549</guid></item><item><title>The Effect of Wealth on Worker Productivity</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16547</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We propose a theory that analyzes how a workers' asset holdings affect their job productivity. In a labor market with uninsurable risk, workers choose to direct their job search trading off productivity and wages against unemployment risk. Workers with low asset holdings have a precautionary job search motive, they direct their search to low productivity jobs because those offer a low risk at the cost of low productivity and a low wage. Our main theoretical contribution shows that the presence of consumption smoothing can reconcile the directed search model with negative duration-dependence on wages, a robust empirical regularity that the canonical directed search model cannot rationalize. We calibrate the infinite horizon economy and find this mechanism to be quantitatively important. We evaluate a tax financed unemployment insurance (UI) scheme and analyze how it affects welfare. Aggregate welfare is inverted U-shaped in benefits: the insurance effect UI dominates the incentive effects for low levels of benefits and vice versa for high benefits. In addition, when UI increases, total production falls in the economy while worker productivity increases.

Survey respondants are requested to report their monthly wages, which we compare to their administrative, fiscal counterparts. We propose a well defined index of worker-level uncertainty which filters out their potential rounding behavior and reporting biases. We estimate it with (unsupervised) ML/EM techniques and obtain that workers tend to perceive their own wages with a degree of uncertainty of around 10%. Through the lens of a simple rational signal extraction model, this amounts to estimates of workers' attention ranging between 30% and 84% depending on their wage level, education, tenure and gender. Most importantly, we show that the attention of the lowest paid 30% of workers is cyclical and increases steadily (by 17 percentage points) in the ten days preceding payday, before dropping instantaneously at that date, which through the lens of a simple model is indicative of end-of-month financing (liquidity) constraints. This pattern furthermore reveals that the cognitive cost induced by these financing constraints arises from not too concave (or convex) costs of achieving high levels of attention, and convex costs of maintaining it over time.]]></description><author>Berson, Clémence &amp; Lardeux, Raphael &amp; Lelarge, Claire</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16541</guid></item><item><title>Improving Workplace Climate in Large Corporations: A Clustered Randomized Intervention</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16532</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We evaluate the impact of a program aiming at improving the workplace climate in corporations.

We intentionally oversample Black respondents, cover many US cities, and survey both adults and young people of ages 13 through 17. In the experimental parts, we consider the causal impact of information on racial inequities (such as the evolution of the Black-white earnings gap or the differences in mobility for Black and white children) and explanations for these inequities (i.e., the deep-seated roots and long-lasting consequences of systemic racism) on respondents' views. Although there is heterogeneity in how respondents perceive the magnitude of current racial gaps in economic conditions and opportunities, the biggest discrepancies are in how they explain them. There is a stark partisan gap among white respondents, particularly in the perceived causes of racial inequities and what should be done about them. White Democrats and Black respondents are much more likely to attribute racial inequities to adverse past and present circumstances and want to act on them with race-targeted and general redistribution policies. White Republicans are more likely to attribute racial gaps to individual actions. These views are already deeply entrenched in teenagers, based on their race and their parents' political affiliation. A policy

These include: damaging competition, consumer privacy and consumer choice; excessively automating work, fueling inequality, inefficiently pushing down wages, and failing to improve worker productivity; and damaging political discourse, democracy's most fundamental lifeblood. Although there is no conclusive evidence suggesting that these costs are imminent or substantial, it may be useful to understand them before they are fully realized and become harder or even impossible to reverse, precisely because of AI's promising and wide-reaching potential. I also suggest that these costs are not inherent to the nature of AI technologies, but are related to how they are being used and developed at the moment - to empower corporations and governments against workers and citizens. As a result, efforts to limit and reverse these costs may need to rely on regulation and policies to redirect AI research. Attempts to contain them

I study this channel in a search and matching model with financial constraints and rigid wages among incumbent workers, while new hires' wages are flexible. Individually, each feature generates no amplification. By contrast, their interaction can account for much of the empirical labor market fluctuations--breaking the neutrality of incumbents' wages for hiring, and showing that financial amplification of business cycles requires wage rigidity.]]></description><author>Schoefer, Benjamin</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16499</guid></item><item><title>Perceived Inequality and Preferences for Redistribution Among High Earners: Do Reference Groups Matter?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16489</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Understanding attitudes towards inequality among the ``working rich" matters for any policy aimed at increasing the level of redistribution in society.

We then explore whether and how comparisons with peers or others (i.e. reference groups) shape their preferences for redistribution.

We can include both preference factors, affecting individuals' preferences over private and public goods, and match quality factors, driving differences in unobserved match quality.

In this paper, we analyze the migration response of American workers to two of the most important shocks that hit US manufacturing since the late 1990s - Chinese import competition and the introduction of industrial robots. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in exposure across US local labor markets over time, we show that robots caused a sizable reduction in population size, while Chinese imports did not. We rationalize these results in two steps. First, we provide evidence that negative employment spillovers outside manufacturing, caused by robots but not by Chinese imports, are an important mechanism for the different migration responses triggered by the two shocks. Next, we present a model where workers are geographically mobile and compete with either machines or foreign labor in the completion of tasks. The model highlights that two key dimensions along which the shocks differ - the cost savings they provide and the degree of complementarity between directly and indirectly exposed industries - can explain their disparate employment effects outside manufacturing and, in turn, the differential migration response.]]></description><author>Faber, Marius &amp; Sarto, Andres &amp; Tabellini, Marco</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16460</guid></item><item><title>Internal Labor Markets: A Worker Flow Approach</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16434</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper develops a new method to study how workers' career and wage profiles are shaped by internal labor markets (ILM) and job hierarchies in firms.

Using a simple production function framework, we show that this labor market competition channel can explain about one quarter of the large increase in the average immigrant-native wage gap in the United States between the 1960s and 1990s arrival cohorts. Once competition effects and compositional changes in education and region of origin are accounted for, we find that the unobservable skills of newly arriving immigrants increased over time rather than decreased as traditionally argued in the literature. We corroborate this finding by documenting closely matching patterns for immigrants' English language proficiency.]]></description><author>Albert, Christoph &amp; Glitz, Albrecht &amp; Llull, Joan</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16432</guid></item><item><title>The Heterogeneous Value of a Statistical Life: Evidence from U.S. Army Reenlistment Decisions</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16425</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper estimates the value of a statistical life (VSL), or the willingness to trade-off wealth and mortality risk, among 430,000 U.S. Army soldiers choosing whether to reenlist between 2002 and 2010. Using a discrete choice random utility approach and significant variation in retention bonuses and mortality risk, we recover average VSL estimates that range between $500,000 and $900,000, an order of magnitude smaller than U.S. civilian labor market estimates. Additionally, we fulfill Rosen's (1974) vision to recover indifference curves between
wealth and non-market goods (e.g., mortality risk) and document substantial heterogeneity in preferences within and across types. We find the VSL increases rapidly with mortality risk within type, and that soldiers in combat occupations have much lower VSLs than those

We conduct a large phone survey and leverage India's geographically-varying containment policies to estimate the association between both the pandemic and its containment policies, and measures of women's well-being, including mental health and food security. On aggregate, the pandemic resulted in dramatic income losses, increases in food insecurity, and declines in female mental health. While potentially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19 cases, we find that greater prevalence of containment policies is associated with increased food insecurity, particularly for women, and with reduced female mental health. Average containment levels are associated with a 39-40% increase in the likelihood of sadness, depression, and hopelessness among women and with an increase in the likelihood that women feel more worried by 45% of the variable mean.

To this question, policymakers on both sides of the pond gave two diametrically
opposed answers during the recent crisis. In the US, the focus was on insuring
workers, by aggressively increasing the generosity of unemployment insurance
(UI). In Europe, to the contrary, policies were concentrated on saving job matches,
with the massive use of labor hoarding subsidies through short-time-work (STW)
programs, on which so little is actually known. In this article, we try to understand
who got it right. Building on the vast literature on UI and on a recent stream of
papers on STW, we first provide a framework to determine the relative welfare
effects of STW versus UI. We then show that UI offers more insurance value than
STW, but tends to exhibit larger fiscal externalities, due to moral hazard. We finally
focus on how STW and UI affect labor market equilibrium and how this interacts
with inefficiencies in the labor market. We review recent evidence showing that
STW can be an effective way to reduce socially costly layoffs in recessions. Overall,
we conclude that STW is an important and useful addition to the labor market
policy-toolkit during recessions, with strong and positive complementarities with
UI.]]></description><author>Giupponi, Giulia &amp; Landais, Camille &amp; Lapeyre, Alice</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16421</guid></item><item><title>Retirement Consumption and Pension Design</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16420</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper develops and implements a framework that leverages consumption
data to evaluate the welfare effects of pension reforms. Several countries have reformed
their pension profiles to incentivize later retirement. Using administrative
data in Sweden, we find that such pension reforms entail substantial consumption
smoothing costs. On average, individuals retiring later have higher consumption
levels than those retiring earlier, implying that recent pension reforms redistributed
from low- to high-consumption households. We show that the differences
in retirement consumption are mostly driven by differential changes in consumption
around retirement, and also that the marginal propensities to consume are
the lowest for late retirees. Accounting for selection on health and life expectancy
further increases the redistributive cost of recent reforms. The cost of incentivizing
later retirement is, however, lowest between the early and normal retirement

We find that there is such a bias. Conditional on objective performance indicators black players receive a lower rating than non-black players. This is not a difference across the board but predominantly present at the lower end of the newspaper rating distribution. The best black players are not subject to a racial bias in ratings. We also find that clubs do not have a racial bias in the wages they pay to players. We speculate that for clubs there is sufficient competition to remove racial wage discrimination. Clubs simply want value for money. Newspaper football experts do seem to have a racial bias in their rating of players. We hypothesize that this might be unconscious discrimination related to stereotyping of black players.]]></description><author>Principe, Francesco &amp; van Ours, Jan C.</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16419</guid></item><item><title>Mothers at Work: How Mandating Paid Maternity Leave Affects Employment, Earnings and Fertility</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16418</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> In July 2005, Switzerland introduced the first federal paid maternity leave mandate, offering 14 weeks of leave with 80% of pre-birth earnings. We study the mandate's impact on women's employment and earnings around the birth of their first child, as well as on their subsequent fertility by exploiting unique, rich administrative data in a difference-in-differences set-up. Women covered by the mandate worked and earned more during pregnancy, and also had temporarily increased job continuity with their pre-birth employer after birth. Estimated effects on other labor market outcomes are small or absent, and all dissipate by five years after birth. The mandate instead persistently increased subsequent fertility: affected women were three percentage points more likely to have a second child in the next nine years. Women living in regions that had greater early child care availability experienced a larger increase in subsequent fertility following the mandate, suggesting that child care complements paid maternity leave in helping women balance work and family.]]></description><author>Lalive, Rafael</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16418</guid></item><item><title>Parental Responses to Information About School Quality: Evidence from Linked Survey and Administrative Data</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16406</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> Multiple inputs determine children's academic achievement. We study the interaction between family and school inputs by identifying the causal impact of information about school quality on parental time investment into children. Our setting is England, where credible information on school quality is provided by a nationwide school inspection regime. Schools are inspected at short notice, with school ratings using hard and soft information. As such soft information is not necessarily known to parents ex ante, inspection ratings provide news to parents that shifts parental beliefs about school quality, and hence their investment into their children. We study this using household panel data linked to administrative records on school performance and inspection ratings. Within the same academic year, we observe some households being interviewed pre school inspection, and others being interviewed post inspection. Treatment assignment is determined by a household's survey date relative to the school inspection date, and shown to be as good as random. We find that parents receiving good news over school quality significantly decrease time investment into their children (relative to parents that will later receive such good news). Our data and design allow us to provide insights on the distributional and test score impacts of the nationwide inspections regime, through multiple margins of endogenous response of parents and children. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for interlinked private responses by families to new public information on school quality.]]></description><author>Greaves, Ellen &amp; Hussain, Iftikhar &amp; Rabe, Birgitta &amp; Rasul, Imran</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16406</guid></item><item><title>Career Effects of Mental Health</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16401</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This paper investigates the career effects of mental health, focusing on depression,
schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (BD). Individual-level registry data from Denmark show
that these disorders carry large earnings penalties, ranging from 34 percent for depression and
38 percent for BD to 74 percent for schizophrenia. To investigate the causal effects of mental
health on a person's career, we exploit the approval of lithium as a maintenance treatment for
BD in 1976. Baseline estimates compare career outcomes for people with and without access
in their 20s, the typical age of onset for BD. These estimates show that access to treatment
eliminates one third of the earnings penalty associated with BD and greatly reduces the risks
of low or no earnings. Importantly, access to treatment closes more than half of the disability
risk associated with BD.]]></description><author>Biasi, Barbara &amp; Dahl, Michael S &amp; Moser, Petra</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16401</guid></item><item><title>The Making of Social Democracy The Economic and Electoral Consequences of Norway's 1936 Folk School Reform</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16398</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> Upon assuming power for the first time in 1935, the Norwegian Labour Party delivered on its promise for a major schooling reform. The reform raised minimum instruction time in less developed rural areas and boosted the resources available to rural schools, reducing
class size and increasing teacher salaries. We document that cohorts more intensively affected by the reform significantly increased their education and experienced higher labor income. Our main result is that the schooling reform also substantially increased support for the Norwegian Labour Party in subsequent elections. This additional support persisted for several decades and was pivotal in maintaining support for the social democratic coalition in Norway. These results are not driven by the direct impact of education and are not explained by higher
turnout, or greater attention or resources from the Labour Party targeted towards the municipalities most affected by the reform. Rather, our evidence suggests that cohorts that benefited from the schooling reform, and their parents, rewarded the party for delivering a major reform
that was beneficial to them.]]></description><author>Acemoglu, Daron &amp; Pekkarinen, Tuomas &amp; Salvanes, Kjell G &amp; Sarvimäki, Matti</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16398</guid></item><item><title>Mandatory Advance Notice of Layoff: Evidence and Efficiency Considerations</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16387</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We investigate a prevalent, but understudied, employment protection policy: mandatory advance notice (MN), requiring employers to notify employees of forthcoming layoffs. MN increases future production, as notified workers search on the job, but reduces current production as they supply less effort. Our theoretical model captures this trade-off and predicts that MN improves production efficiency by increasing information sharing, whereas large production losses can be avoided by worker-firm agreements on side-payments â?? severance pay â?? in lieu of MN. We provide evidence of such severance increases in response to an extension of MN using novel Swedish administrative data. We then estimate the production gain of MN: extending the MN period leads to shorter non-employment duration and higher reemployment wages, plausibly driven by on-the-job search. Using variation in notice duration across firms, we estimate the productivity loss of notice. The estimates of benefits and costs suggest that MN has a positive net impact on production, offering an empirically-grounded efficiency argument for mandating notice.]]></description><author>Cederlöf, Jonas &amp; Fredriksson, Peter &amp; Nekoei, Arash &amp; Seim, David</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16387</guid></item><item><title>Teacher Compensation and Structural Inequality: Evidence from Centralized Teacher School Choice in Peru</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16386</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This paper studies how increasing teacher compensation at hard-to-staff schools can reduce inequality in access to qualified teachers. Leveraging an unconditional change in the teacher compensation structure in Peru, we first show causal evidence that increasing salaries at less desirable locations attracts better quality applicants and improves student test scores. We then estimate a model of teacher preferences over local amenities, school characteristics, and wages using geocoded job postings and rich application data from the nationwide centralized teacher assignment system. Our estimated model suggests that the current policy is both ineâ??cient and not large enough to effectively undo the inequality of initial conditions that hard-to-staffâ??schools and their communities face. Counterfactual analyses that incorporate equilibrium sorting effects characterize alternative wage schedules and quantify the cost of reducing structural inequality in the allocation of teacher talent across schools.]]></description><author>Bobba, Matteo &amp; Ederer, Tim &amp; León-Ciliotta, Gianmarco &amp; Neilson, Christopher &amp; Nieddu, Marco</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16386</guid></item><item><title>Pandemic Lockdown: The Role of Government Commitment</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16384</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This paper studies lockdown policy in a dynamic economy without government commitment. Lockdown imposes a cap on labor supply, which improves health prospects at the cost of economic output and consumption. A government would like to commit to the extent of future lockdowns in order to guarantee an economic outlook that supports efficient levels of investment into intermediate inputs. However, such a commitment is not credible, since investments are sunk at the time when the government chooses a lockdown. As a result, lockdown under lack of commitment deviates from the optimal policy. Rules that limit a government's lockdown discretion can improve social welfare, even in the presence of noncontractible information. Quantitatively, lack of commitment causes lockdown to be significantly more severe than is socially optimal. The output and consumption loss due to lack of commitment is greater for higher intermediate input shares, higher discount rates, higher values of life, higher disease transmission rates at and outside of work, and longer vaccine arrival times.]]></description><author>Moser, Christian &amp; Yared, Pierre</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16384</guid></item><item><title>The Gender Pay Gap: Micro Sources and Macro Consequences</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16383</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We document that a large share of the gender pay gap in Brazil is due to women working at lower-paying employers. However, compared with that of men, women's revealed-preference ranking of employers is less increasing in pay. To interpret these facts, we develop an empirical equilibrium search model with endogenous gender differences in pay, amenities, and recruiting intensities across employers. The estimated model suggests that compensating differentials explain one-fifth of the gender pay gap, that there are significant output and welfare gains from eliminating gender differences, and that equal-treatment policies fail to close the gender pay gap.]]></description><author>Morchio, Iacopo &amp; Moser, Christian</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16383</guid></item><item><title>Trade and Informality in the Presence of Labor Market Frictions and Regulations</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=-83459</link><description><![CDATA[<b>January 2021</b> <p> We build an equilibrium model of a small open economy with labor market frictions and imperfectly enforced regulations. Heterogeneous firms sort into the formal or informal sector. We estimate the model using data from Brazil, and use counterfactual simulations to understand how trade affects economic outcomes in the presence of informality. We show that: (1) Trade openness unambiguously decreases informality in the tradable sector, but has ambiguous effects on aggregate informality. (2) The productivity gains from trade are understated when the informal sector is omitted. (3) Trade openness results in large welfare gains even when informality is repressed. (4) Repressing informality increases productivity, but at the expense of employment and welfare. (5) The effects of trade on wage inequality are reversed when the informal sector is incorporated in the analysis. (6) The informal sector works as an "unemployment," but not a "welfare buffer" in the event of negative economic shocks.]]></description><author>Dix-Carneiro, Rafael &amp; Goldberg, Pinelopi Koujianou &amp; Meghir, Costas &amp; Ulyssea, Gabriel</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=-83459</guid></item></channel></rss>
