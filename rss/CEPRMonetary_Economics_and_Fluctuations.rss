We use survey and scanner data on households' consumption expenditures
and their perceived pass-through of the tax change into prices to quantify its effects. The temporary VAT cut led to a substantial relative increase in durable spending of 36% for individuals with a high perceived pass-through. Semi- and non-durable spending also increased. According to our preferred estimates, the VAT policy increased aggregate consumption spending by 34 billion Euros.]]></description><author>Bachmann, Rüdiger &amp; Born, Benjamin &amp; Goldfayn, Olga &amp; Kocharkov, Georgi &amp; Luetticke, Ralph &amp; Weber, Michael</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16690</guid></item><item><title>Uncertainty and Change: Survey Evidence of Firms' Subjective Beliefs</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16689</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Bachmann, Rüdiger & Carstensen, Kai & Lautenbacher, Stefan & Schneider, Martin.</i> <p> <b>Monday, 01 11 2021.</b> <p> This paper studies how managers plan under uncertainty. In a new survey panel on German manufacturing firms, we show that uncertainty reflects change: Planning incorporates higher subjective uncertainty about future sales growth when the firm has just experienced unusual growth, and more so if the experience was negative. At the quarterly frequency, subjective uncertainty closely tracks conditional volatility of shocks: Both exhibit an asymmetric V-shaped relationship with past growth. In the cross section of firms, however, subjective uncertainty differs from conditional volatility: planning in successful firms-either large or fast-growing-reflects lower subjective uncertainty than in unsuccessful firms even when the size of the shocks is the same.]]></description><author>Bachmann, Rüdiger &amp; Carstensen, Kai &amp; Lautenbacher, Stefan &amp; Schneider, Martin</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16689</guid></item><item><title>The Central Bank, the Treasury, or the Market: Which One Determines the Price Level?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16679</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Barthelemy, Jean & Mengus, Eric & Plantin, Guillaume.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> This paper studies a model in which the price level is the outcome of dynamic strategic interactions between a fiscal authority, a monetary authority, and investors in government bonds and reserves.

We show that this assumption is inconsistent with rational information choice for plausible information costs. To do so, we embed information choice into the workhorse heterogeneous-agent model with aggregate risk (Krusell and Smith, 1998). First, we demonstrate that the benefits of acquiring more precise information about the state of the economy depend crucially on household wealth. Second, we show that such heterogeneous incentives to acquire information combine with the strategic substitutability of savings choices to imply that equilibria in which households acquire the same information do not exist for plausible information costs. Finally, we document that a representative-agent equilibrium may not exist even in the absence of exogenous sources of wealth heterogeneity.]]></description><author>Broer, Tobias &amp; Kohlhas, Alexandre &amp; Mitman, Kurt &amp; Schlafmann, Kathrin</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16667</guid></item><item><title>Losing the inflation anchor</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16664</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Reis, Ricardo.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Inflation has an anchor in people's expectations of what its long-run value will be. If expectations persistently change, then the anchor is adrift; if they differ from the central bank's target, the anchor is lost. This paper uses data on expectations from market prices, from professional surveys, and from the cross-sectional distribution of household surveys to measure shifts in this anchor. Its main application is to the US Great Inflation. The data suggests that the anchor started drifting as early as 1967 and that this could have been spotted well before policymakers did. Using this approach on expectations data from Brazil, Turkey, South Africa, the US in the 1970s, and the US in 2021, confirms their usefulness to measure the inflation anchor in real time.]]></description><author>Reis, Ricardo</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16664</guid></item><item><title>The Fiscal and Welfare Effects of Policy Responses to the Covid-19 School Closures</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16663</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Fuchs-Schündeln, Nicola & Krueger, Dirk & Kurmann, Andre & Lale, Etienne & Ludwig, Alexander & Popova, Irina.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Using a structural life-cycle model and data on school visits from Safegraph and school
closures from Burbio, we quantify the heterogeneous impact of school closures during the
Corona crisis on children affected at different ages and coming from households with different
parental characteristics. Our data suggests that secondary schools were closed for
in-person learning for longer periods than elementary schools (implying that younger children
experienced less school closures than older children), and that private schools experienced
shorter closures than public schools, and schools in poorer U.S. counties experienced
shorter school closures. We then extend the structural life cycle model of private and
public schooling investments studied in Fuchs-SchÃ¼ndeln, Krueger, Ludwig, and Popova
(2021) to include the choice of parents whether to send their children to private schools,
empirically discipline it with data on parental investments from the PSID, and then feed
into the model the school closure measures from our empirical analysis to quantify the
long-run consequences of the Covid-19 school closures on the cohorts of children currently
in school. Future earnings- and welfare losses are largest for children that started public
secondary schools at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. Comparing children from the top to
children from the bottom quartile of the income distribution, welfare losses are ca. 0.8
percentage points larger for the poorer children if school closures were unrelated to income.
Accounting for the longer school closures in richer counties reduces this gap by about 1/3.
A policy intervention that extends schools by 3 months (6 weeks in the next two summers)
generates significant welfare gains for the children and raises future tax revenues approximately
sufficient to pay for the cost of this schooling expansion.]]></description><author>Fuchs-Schündeln, Nicola &amp; Krueger, Dirk &amp; Kurmann, Andre &amp; Lale, Etienne &amp; Ludwig, Alexander &amp; Popova, Irina</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16663</guid></item><item><title>Zombie Lending and Policy Traps</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16658</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Acharya, Viral V. & Lenzu, Simone & Wang, Olivier.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We build a model with heterogeneous firms and banks to analyze how policy can affect
the efficiency of credit allocation and long-term economic outcomes. When transitory
demand or productivity shocks are small, conventional monetary policy can restore
efficient bank lending and production by lowering interest rates. For moderately large
shocks, however, conventional policy may hit the effective lower bound, necessitating
unconventional policy such as regulatory forbearance towards banks to stabilize the
economy. Aggressive unconventional policy runs the risk of introducing zombie lending and a "diabolical sorting", whereby low-capitalization banks extend new credit or
evergreen existing loans to low-productivity firms. In a dynamic setting, policy aimed
at avoiding short-term recessions can be trapped into protracted excessive forbearance due to congestion externalities imposed by zombie lending on healthier firms.
The resulting economic sclerosis transforms transitory shocks into phases of delayed
recovery and potentially permanent output losses. Our model highlights the importance of maintaining a well-capitalized banking system to avoid such policy traps as
not raising capital requirements upfront but raising them significantly upon the arrival
of shocks can also backfire by encouraging zombie lending.]]></description><author>Acharya, Viral V. &amp; Lenzu, Simone &amp; Wang, Olivier</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16658</guid></item><item><title>The Geography of Job Creation and Job Destruction</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16645</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Kuhn, Moritz & Manovskii, Iourii & Qiu, Xincheng.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Spatial differences in labor market performance are large and highly persistent.

We find that a spatial version of a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model with endogenous separations and on-the-job search quantitatively accounts for all the documented empirical regularities.

We document two stylized facts on how unemployment and unemployment risk respond to identified demand and supply shocks in US data. First, separation and job-finding rates play similar important roles in accounting for the overall unemployment response. Second, separations are more important early on, while job-finding rates respond with a lag. We show how a tractable heterogeneous-agent new-Keynesian model with a frictional labor market matches both facts once we include endogenous separations and sluggish vacancy creation. Relative to a model with exogenous separations and free entry, our framework attributes almost twice as large a share of output fluctuations to the inefficient unemployment-risk channel, and thus gives a larger role to stabilization policy.]]></description><author>Broer, Tobias &amp; Druedahl, Jeppe &amp; Harmenberg, Karl &amp; Öberg, Erik</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16639</guid></item><item><title>Empirical Investigation of a Sufficient Statistic for Monetary Shocks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16626</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Alvarez, Fernando & Ferrara, Andrea & Gautier, Erwan & Le Bihan, Hervé & Lippi, Francesco.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> In a broad class of sticky price models the non-neutrality of nominal shocks is encoded by a simple sufficient statistic: the ratio of the kurtosis of the size-distribution of price changes over the frequency of price changes. We test this theoretical prediction using data for a large number of firms representative of the French economy. We use the micro data to measure the cross sectional moments, including kurtosis and frequency, for about 120 PPI industries and 220 CPI categories. We use a Factor Augmented VAR to measure the sectoral responses to a monetary shock, as summarized by the cumulative impulse response of sectoral prices (CIRP ), under three alternative identification schemes. The estimated CIRP correlates with the kurtosis and the frequency consistently with the prediction of the theory (i.e. they enter the relationship as a ratio). The analysis also shows that other moments not suggested by the theory, such as the mean, standard deviation and skewness of the size-distribution of price changes, are not correlated with the CIRP .

Heterogeneity determines whether liquidity traps are confidence-driven or fundamental, excess-saving driven, where the latter can be triggered by shocks to inequality or income risk. Heterogeneity amplifies liquidity-trap recessions (without relying on deep deflations), fiscal multipliers, and forward-guidance power when income inequality and risk are countercyclical. Dampening occurs instead when inequality and risk are procyclical, ruling out confidence-driven traps, neo-Fisherian effects, and the forward guidance puzzle.

However, other important aspects of digitalisation, such as the growth in private digital currencies, haven't weakened cash's role as a store of value.

With Full Commitment, optimal fiscal announcements are unbiased forecasts of future taxes. Costly state contingency dampens the response of both current and future capital taxes to government spending shocks, because the government uses announcements about future taxes to stimulate current output. Labor taxes play a major role in accommodating fiscal shocks. This mechanism allows the model to successfully match the empirical volatility of tax rates.
In the absence of Full Commitment, optimal fiscal announcements are strategically biased. Costly state contingency generates an endogenous degree of fiscal commitment, leading to a positive, but low average capital tax---approximately 8% in our calibrated model.]]></description><author>Clymo, Alex &amp; Lanteri, Andrea &amp; Villa, Alessandro</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16616</guid></item><item><title>Macroprudential Policy during COVID-19: The Role of Policy Space</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16607</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Bergant, Katharina & Forbes, Kristin.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> This paper uses the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to examine how macroprudential frameworks developed over the past decade performed during a period of heightened financial and economic stress. It discusses a new measure of the macroprudential stance that better captures the intensity of different policies across countries and time. Then it shows that macroprudential policy has been used countercyclically-with stances tightened during the 2010's and eased in response to COVID-19 by more than previous risk-off periods. Countries that tightened macroprudential policy more aggressively before COVID, as well as those that eased more during the pandemic, experienced less financial and economic stress. Countries' ability to use macroprudential policy, however, was significantly constrained by the extent of existing "policy space", i.e., by how aggressively policy was tightened before COVID-19. The use of macroprudential tools was not significantly affected by the space available to use other policy tools (such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, FX intervention, and capital flow management measures), and the use of other tools was not significantly affected by the space available to use macroprudential policy. This suggests that although macroprudential tools are being used countercyclically and should therefore help stabilize economies and financial markets, there appears to be an opportunity to better integrate the use of macroprudential tools with other policies in the future.]]></description><author>Bergant, Katharina &amp; Forbes, Kristin</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16607</guid></item><item><title>Exposure, Experience, and Expertise: Why Personal Histories Matter in Economics</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16598</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Malmendier, Ulrike M..</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Personal experiences of economic outcomes, from global financial crises to individual-level job losses, can shape individual beliefs, risk attitudes, and choices for years to come. A growing literature on experience effects shows that individuals act as if past outcomes that they experienced were overly likely to occur again, even if they are fully informed about the actual likelihood. This reaction to past experiences is long-lasting though it decays over time as individuals accumulate new experiences. Modern brain science helps understand these processes. Evidence on neuroplasticity reveals that personal experiences and learning alter the strength of neural connections and fine-tune the brain structure to those past experiences ("use-dependent brain"). I show that experience effects help understand belief formation and decision-making in a wide area of economic applications, including inflation, home purchases, mortgage choices, and consumption expenditures.

The nonlinear curve is steep when output is above potential (slack is negative) but flat when output is below potential (slack is positive) so that further increases in economic slack have little effect on inflation. This finding is consistent with evidence of downward nominal wage and price rigidity. When inflation is high, the Phillips curve is linear and relatively steep. These results are robust to placing the threshold between the high and low inflation regimes at 2, 3, or 4 percent inflation or for a threshold based on country-specific medians of inflation.

The paper highlights the roles played by two streams of thought associated with Milton Friedman: Monetarist theories predicting a key role for monetary aggregates in determining inflation and the rise in popularity of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve. We discuss influence of the latter in determining the modern consensus on central bank institutions and the relative roles for fiscal and monetary policies.

the credit channel. For identification, we exploit matched administrative datasets in Portugal
- employee-employer and credit registers - and monetary policy since the Eurozone creation
in 1999. We find that softer monetary policy improves worker labor market outcomes (wages,
hours worked and firm employment) more in small and young firms, which are more financially
constrained. Within small and young firms, the wage effects accrue to incumbent workers,
in line with the back-loaded wage mechanism. Consistent with the capital-skill complementarity
mechanism, we document an increase in skill premium and show that financially constrained
firms increase both physical and human capital investment by most. Our findings uncover
a central role for both the firm-balance sheet and the bank lending channels of the monetary

Unfortunately, those low levels of unemployment are short lived. In the last 60 years, the US has not witnessed a long period of stable and low unemployment. We argue that this result is consistent with an asymmetric view of the business cycles (as in Friedman's plucking model) where many expansions are unfinished business, they end too early. The speed of labor market recovery is too slow and before the economy reaches full employment a recession starts, either because of imbalances or bad luck. Our analysis has implications for how we think about labor market slack and potential output. From a policy perspective it calls for a focus on faster recoveries while avoiding the type of imbalances that can be the seed of the next crisis.]]></description><author>Fatás, Antonio</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16535</guid></item><item><title>Commodity Prices and Global Inflation, 1851-1913</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16526</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Gerlach, Stefan & Stuart, Rebecca.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> This paper uses annual data to study the interaction of consumer and commodity prices in 15 economies over the period 1850-1913. We find that consumer price inflation in all 15 countries co-moves with a broad measure of changes in commodity prices. Consumer prices comove most strongly with changes in metal prices, in particular pig iron prices. Furthermore, changes in pig iron prices and production, which have attracted much attention in the literature on 19th century US business cycles, co-move with the international business cycle, suggesting that pig iron prices offer a transmission channel through which international business cycle movements affect inflation.]]></description><author>Gerlach, Stefan &amp; Stuart, Rebecca</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16526</guid></item><item><title>Central Bank Communication with Non-Experts - A Road to Nowhere?</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16525</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Ehrmann, Michael & Wabitsch, Alena.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Central banks have intensified their communication with non-experts â?? an endeavour which some have argued is bound to fail. This paper studies English and German Twitter traffic about the ECB to understand whether its communication is received by non-experts and how it affects their views. It shows that Twitter traffic is responsive to ECB communication, also for non-experts. For several ECB communication events, Twitter constitutes primarily a channel to relay information: tweets become more factual and the views expressed more moderate and homogeneous. Other communication events, such as former President Draghi's "Whatever it takes" statement, trigger persistent traffic and a divergence in views. Also, ECB-related tweets are more likely to get retweeted or liked if they express stronger or more subjective views. Thus, Twitter also serves as a platform for controversial discussions. The findings suggest that central banks manage to reach non-experts, i.e. their communication is not a road to nowhere.]]></description><author>Ehrmann, Michael &amp; Wabitsch, Alena</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16525</guid></item><item><title>Spending a Windfall</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16523</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Palma, Nuno Pedro G. & Silva, André.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> We study the effect of the discovery of precious metals in America on international trade from 1500 to 1810. Around 1500, there was a simultaneous discovery of precious metals and new trading routes. We construct a counterfactual scenario of new routes but no precious metals. The discovery of precious metals was a windfall to Europe. It increased the stock of precious metals in the world more than tenfold. Compared with the case of no trade routes and no precious metals, Euro-Asian trade increases up to 20 times.

However, the presence of time-varying risk premia requires an adjustment of market prices to obtain the market's rational assessment of future price and policy developments. This paper reviews empirical approaches for recovering market-based expectations. It starts by laying out the two canonical modeling frameworks that form the backbone for estimating risk premia and highlights the proliferation of risk pricing factors that result in a wide range of different asset-price-based expectation measures. It then describes a key methodological innovation to evaluate the empirical plausibility of risk premium estimates and to identify the most accurate market-based expectation measure. The usefulness of this general approach is illustrated for price expectations in the global oil market. Then, the paper provides an overview of the body of empirical evidence for monetary policy and inflation expectations with a special emphasis on market-specific characteristics that complicate the quest for the best possible market-based expectation measure. Finally, it discusses a number of economic applications where market expectations play a key role for evaluating economic models, guiding policy analysis, and deriving shock measures.]]></description><author>Baumeister, Christiane</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16520</guid></item><item><title>Measuring credit procyclicality: a new database</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16519</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Bouvatier, Vincent & Delatte, Anne-Laure & Rehault, Pierre-Nicolas.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Today, the data available to estimate the credit cycle involve a trade-off between country coverage and frequency. In addition, there are pending methodological issues to estimate credit trend and cyclical components. To address these limits, we build a new database on credit metrics that relaxes the trade-off  and includes credit procyclicality measures along three alternative methods- HP filter, the modified HP filter and basic SSA. The credit gaps in our database are statistically consistent with bank credit gaps estimated with BIS data and they have the advantage of being available for 163 countries instead of 43 countries.

For identification, we exploit the simultaneous introduction of capital controls on foreign exchange (FX) debt inflows and an increase of reserve requirements on domestic bank deposits in Colombia during a strong credit boom, as well as credit registry and bank balance sheet data. Our results suggest that first, an increase in the local monetary policy rate, raising the interest rate spread with the United States, allows more FX-indebted banks to carry trade cheap FX funds with more expensive peso lending, especially toward riskier, opaque firms. Capital controls tax FX debt and break the carry trade. Second, the increase in reserve requirements on domestic deposits directly reduces credit supply, and more so for riskier, opaque firms, rather than enhances the transmission of monetary rates on credit supply. Importantly, different banks finance credit in the boom with either domestic or foreign (FX) financing. Hence, capital controls and domestic macroprudential policy complementarily mitigate the boom and the associated risk-taking through two distinct channels.]]></description><author>Fabiani, Andrea &amp; Lopéz Piñeros, Martha &amp; Peydró, José Luis &amp; Soto, Paul</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16510</guid></item><item><title>Systemic Implications of the Bail-In Design</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16509</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Farmer, Doyne & Goodhart, Charles A & Kleinnijenhuis, Alissa M..</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> The 2007-2008 financial crisis forced governments to choose between the unattractive alternatives of either bailing out a systemically important bank (SIB) or allowing it to fail in a disorderly manner. Bail-in has been put forward as an alternative that potentially addresses the too-big-to-fail problem and contagion risk simultaneously. Though its efficacy has been demonstrated for smaller idiosyncratic SIB failures, its ability to maintain stability in cases of large SIB failures and system-wide crises remains untested. This paper's novelty is to assess the financial-stability implications of bail-in design, explicitly accounting for the multi-layered networked nature of the financial system. We present a model of the European financial system that captures five prevailing contagion channels. We demonstrate that it is essential to understand the interaction of multiple contagion mechanisms and that financial institutions other than banks play an important role. Our results indicate that stability hinges on the
bank-specific and structural bail-in design. On the one hand, a well-designed bail-in buttresses financial resilience, but on the other hand, an ill-designed bail-in tends to exacerbate financial distress, especially in system-wide crises and when there are large SIB failures. Our analysis suggests that the current bail-in design may be in the region of instability. While policy makers can fix this, the political economy incentives make this unlikely.]]></description><author>Farmer, Doyne &amp; Goodhart, Charles A &amp; Kleinnijenhuis, Alissa M.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16509</guid></item></channel></rss>
