The identification
strategy exploits the 1995 European Union (EU) enlargement, when all candidate countries
joined the Single Market but one - Norway - did not join the EU. Our synthetic
difference-in-differences estimates on sectoral and regional data suggest had Norway chosen
deeper integration, the average Norwegian region would have experienced an increase
in yearly productivity growth of about 0.6 percentage points. This method also helps determining
the sources of heterogeneity, apparently inherent to integration, highlighting higher
costs of the missed deeper integration for more peripheral regions and industrial sector.]]></description><author>Campos, Nauro F. &amp; Coricelli, Fabrizio &amp; Franceschi, Emanuele</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16696</guid></item><item><title>The Effects of COVID-19 Vaccines on Economic Activity</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16682</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> This paper empirically examines the economic effects of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts using a cross-country daily database of vaccinations and high frequency indicators of economic activity-nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, and Google mobility indices-for a sample of 46 countries over the period December 16, 2020 to June 20, 2021. Using surprises in vaccines administered, we find that an unexpected increase in vaccination per capita is associated with a significant increase in economic activity. We also find evidence for non-linear effects of vaccines, with the marginal economic benefits being larger when vaccination rates are higher. Country-specific conditions play an important role, with lower economic gains if strict containment measures are in place or if the country is experiencing a severe outbreak. Finally, the results provide evidence of spillovers across borders, highlighting the importance of equitable access to vaccines across nations.]]></description><author>Deb, Pragyan &amp; Furceri, Davide &amp; Jimenez, Daniel &amp; Kothari, Siddharth &amp; Ostry, Jonathan D. &amp; Tawk, Nour</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16682</guid></item><item><title>Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Rollouts and Their Effects on Health Outcomes</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16681</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> This paper examines empirically the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and their effects on health outcomes. We assemble a comprehensive and novel cross-country database at a daily frequency on vaccinations and various health outcomes (new COVID-19 cases, fatalities, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions) for the period December 16, 2020â??June 20, 2021. Using this data, we find that: (i) early vaccine procurement, domestic production of vaccines, the severity of the pandemic, a country's health infrastructure, and vaccine acceptance are significant determinants of the speed of vaccination rollouts; (ii) vaccine deployment significantly reduces new COVID-19 infections, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, and fatalities, and is more effective when coupled with stringent containment measures, or when a country is experiencing a large outbreak; and (iii) COVID-19 cases in neighboring countries can lead to an increase in a country's domestic caseload, and hamper efforts in taming its own local outbreak.]]></description><author>Deb, Pragyan &amp; Furceri, Davide &amp; Jimenez, Daniel &amp; Kothari, Siddharth &amp; Ostry, Jonathan D. &amp; Tawk, Nour</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16681</guid></item><item><title>A q-theory of banks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16670</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We propose a dynamic bank theory with a delayed loss recognition mechanism and a regulatory capital constraint at its core.

At the same time, monetary policies are set independently and have spillover effects on partner countries ('currency wars'). We combine these two scenarios, and show that they interact in deep and interesting ways. The stance of monetary policy has substantial effects on the equilibrium degree of protection in a Nash equilibrium of the monetary and trade policy game. Trade wars lead to higher equilibrium inflation rates. Cooperation in monetary policy leads to both higher inflation and greater degree of trade protection. By contrast, when monetary policy is constrained by pegged exchange rates or the zero lower bound on interest rates, equilibrium tariffs are lower. Finally, when one country has the dominant currency in trade, it gains a large advantage in a trade war.]]></description><author>Auray, Stephane &amp; Devereux, Michael B &amp; Eyquem, Aurélien</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16651</guid></item><item><title>A Mountain of Debt: Navigating the Legacy of the Pandemic</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16637</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a massive increase in global debt levels and exacerbated the trade-offs between the benefits and costs of accumulating government debt. This paper examines these trade-offs by putting the recent debt boom into a historical context. It reports three major findings. First, during the 2020 global recession, both global government and private debt levels rose to record highs, and at their fastest single-year pace, in five decades. Second, the debt-financed, massive fiscal support programs implemented during the pandemic supported activity and illustrated the benefits of accumulating debt. However, as the recovery gains traction, the balance of benefits and costs of debt accumulation could increasingly tilt toward costs. Third, more than two-thirds of emerging market and developing economies are currently in government debt booms. On average, the current booms have already lasted three years longer, and are accompanied by a considerably larger fiscal deterioration, than earlier booms. About half of the earlier debt booms were associated with financial crises in emerging market and developing economies.]]></description><author>Kose, Ayhan &amp; Ohnsorge, Franziska &amp; Sugawara, Naotaka</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16637</guid></item><item><title>International trade and letters of credit: A double-edged sword in times of crises</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16630</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> This study argues that the ability to mitigate risks associated with international trade is particularly important at times of heightened uncertainty, such as the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Risk mitigation can be achieved through letters of credit (LCs), trade finance instruments providing guarantees to trading partners. As their use varies across products, exports of some products are more resilient than others during times of increased uncertainty. This situation reverses in times of financial crises when distressed banks may limit the supply of LCs. Our analysis using data on US and EU-15 exports during the Covid crisis and the Global Financial Crisis provides empirical support for these hypotheses.]]></description><author>Crozet, Matthieu &amp; Demir, Banu &amp; Javorcik, Beata</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16630</guid></item><item><title>Monetary Policy and Bond Prices with Drifting Equilibrium Rates</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16629</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We study drift and cyclical components in U.S. Treasury bonds. We find that bond yields are drifting because they reflect the drift in monetary policy rates. Empirically, modeling the monetary policy drift using demographics and productivity trends, plus long-term inflation expectations, leads to cyclical deviations of bond prices from their drift that predict bond returns in- and out-of-sample. These bond cycles can originate from term premia or temporary deviations from rational expectations in a behavioral framework. Through the lens of our model, we detect a significant role of the latter in determining the cyclical properties of yields with short maturities.]]></description><author>Favero, Carlo A. &amp; Melone, Alessandro &amp; Tamoni, Andrea</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16629</guid></item><item><title>Empirical Investigation of a Sufficient Statistic for Monetary Shocks</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16626</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> In a broad class of sticky price models the non-neutrality of nominal shocks is encoded by a simple sufficient statistic: the ratio of the kurtosis of the size-distribution of price changes over the frequency of price changes. We test this theoretical prediction using data for a large number of firms representative of the French economy. We use the micro data to measure the cross sectional moments, including kurtosis and frequency, for about 120 PPI industries and 220 CPI categories. We use a Factor Augmented VAR to measure the sectoral responses to a monetary shock, as summarized by the cumulative impulse response of sectoral prices (CIRP ), under three alternative identification schemes. The estimated CIRP correlates with the kurtosis and the frequency consistently with the prediction of the theory (i.e. they enter the relationship as a ratio). The analysis also shows that other moments not suggested by the theory, such as the mean, standard deviation and skewness of the size-distribution of price changes, are not correlated with the CIRP . Several robustness checks are discussed.]]></description><author>Alvarez, Fernando &amp; Ferrara, Andrea &amp; Gautier, Erwan &amp; Le Bihan, Hervé &amp; Lippi, Francesco</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16626</guid></item><item><title>Currency Volatility and Global Technological Innovation</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16611</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> We investigate the real effects of foreign exchange (FX) volatility on technological innovation. Using a 32-market, three-decade sample, we show that heightened FX volatility associates with significantly lower firm-level R&D expenditures, patents granted, and forward citations. The negative FX volatility-innovation relation can be attributed to precautionary savings needs and trade slowdown. The relationship is stronger for firms with financial constraints, with the use of foreign debt, and in more open economies; it is weaker for firms with derivatives hedging, with higher sales, and in countries with better financial development. We also use FX regime changes and the collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism to support a causal interpretation]]></description><author>Hsu, Po-Hsuan &amp; Taylor, Mark &amp; Wang, Zigan &amp; Xu, Qi</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16611</guid></item><item><title>Lessons of Keynes's Economic Consequences in a Turbulent Century</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16610</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Just over a century old, John Maynard Keynes's The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919) remains a seminal document of the twentieth century. At the time, the book was a prescient analysis of political events to come. In the decades that followed, this still controversial text became an essential ingredient in the unfolding of history. In this essay, we review the arc of experience since 1919 from the perspective of Keynes's influence and his changing understanding of economics, politics, and geopolitics. We identify how he, his ideas, and this text became key reference points during times of turbulence as actors sought to manage a range of shocks. Near the end of his life, Keynes would play a central role in planning the world economy's reconstruction after World War II. We argue that the "global order" that evolved since then, marked by increasingly polarized societies, leaves the community of nations ill prepared to provide key global public goods or to counter critical collective threats.]]></description><author>Clavin, Patricia &amp; Corsetti, Giancarlo &amp; Obstfeld, Maurice &amp; Tooze, Adam</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16610</guid></item><item><title>Macroprudential Policy during COVID-19: The Role of Policy Space</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16607</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> This paper uses the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to examine how macroprudential frameworks developed over the past decade performed during a period of heightened financial and economic stress. It discusses a new measure of the macroprudential stance that better captures the intensity of different policies across countries and time. Then it shows that macroprudential policy has been used countercyclically-with stances tightened during the 2010's and eased in response to COVID-19 by more than previous risk-off periods. Countries that tightened macroprudential policy more aggressively before COVID, as well as those that eased more during the pandemic, experienced less financial and economic stress. Countries' ability to use macroprudential policy, however, was significantly constrained by the extent of existing "policy space", i.e., by how aggressively policy was tightened before COVID-19. The use of macroprudential tools was not significantly affected by the space available to use other policy tools (such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, FX intervention, and capital flow management measures), and the use of other tools was not significantly affected by the space available to use macroprudential policy. This suggests that although macroprudential tools are being used countercyclically and should therefore help stabilize economies and financial markets, there appears to be an opportunity to better integrate the use of macroprudential tools with other policies in the future.]]></description><author>Bergant, Katharina &amp; Forbes, Kristin</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16607</guid></item><item><title>Hot Money Inflows and Bank Risk-Taking: Germany from the 1920s to the Great Depression</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16606</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> What is the impact of hot capital inflows on bank risk-taking? In an increasingly financially globalised world this question becomes especially relevant. However few authors have examined it in detail empirically, despite repeated crises in Latin America, East Asia and the Eurozone from the 1980s to the 2010s. In this paper, we collect individual bank data on one of history's most striking examples of a "supply push" in foreign funds: the great inflow of capital from the developed world to Germany in the second half of the 1920s. Bank by bank we examine its effects on decisions related to leverage, lending and liquidity. The specificities of the time period â?? the Dawes Plan of 1924 as well as the relative absence of a Too-Big-to-Fail environment, which we document through extensive historiographical analysis â?? allow us to mitigate endogeneity concerns. We develop a three-step approach in which we run panel regressions including only months of falling interest-rate spreads, and apply a two-stage least-squares model in which initial bank size is used as an instrument. In all our models our results tend to converge: while capital inflows did not seem to impact banks' liquidity decisions, their impact on leverage was non-negligeable. This paper's results thus call for extra prudential oversight whenever cross-border banking flows increase significantly.]]></description><author>Collet, Stéphanie &amp; Postel-Vinay, Natacha</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16606</guid></item><item><title>Exposure, Experience, and Expertise: Why Personal Histories Matter in Economics</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16598</link><description><![CDATA[<b>October 2021</b> <p> Personal experiences of economic outcomes, from global financial crises to individual-level job losses, can shape individual beliefs, risk attitudes, and choices for years to come. A growing literature on experience effects shows that individuals act as if past outcomes that they experienced were overly likely to occur again, even if they are fully informed about the actual likelihood. This reaction to past experiences is long-lasting though it decays over time as individuals accumulate new experiences. Modern brain science helps understand these processes. Evidence on neuroplasticity reveals that personal experiences and learning alter the strength of neural connections and fine-tune the brain structure to those past experiences ("use-dependent brain"). I show that experience effects help understand belief formation and decision-making in a wide area of economic applications, including inflation, home purchases, mortgage choices, and consumption expenditures. I argue that experience-based learning is broadly applicable to economic decision-making and discuss topics for future research in education, health, race, and gender economics.]]></description><author>Malmendier, Ulrike M.</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16598</guid></item><item><title>Low Inflation Bends the Phillips Curve around the World</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16583</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> This paper finds strong support for a Phillips curve that becomes nonlinear when inflation is "low"- which our baseline model defines as less than 3 percent. The nonlinear curve is steep when output is above potential (slack is negative) but flat when output is below potential (slack is positive) so that further increases in economic slack have little effect on inflation. This finding is consistent with evidence of downward nominal wage and price rigidity. When inflation is high, the Phillips curve is linear and relatively steep. These results are robust to placing the threshold between the high and low inflation regimes at 2, 3, or 4 percent inflation or for a threshold based on country-specific medians of inflation.
In this nonlinear model, international factors play a large role in explaining headline inflation (albeit less
so for core inflation), a role that has been increasing since the global financial crisis.]]></description><author>Collins, Christopher &amp; Forbes, Kristin &amp; Gagnon, Joseph</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16583</guid></item><item><title>The Global Financial Cycle</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16580</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We review the literature on the empirical characteristics of the global financial cycle and associated stylized facts on international capital flows, asset prices, risk aversion and liquidity in the financial system.

We present evidence of the causal effects of the monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and of the People's Bank of China on the Global Financial Cycle.

First, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 and policy responses on small and medium sized enterprise (SME) business failures. We combine firm-level financial data from 50 sectors in 27 countries, a detailed I-O network, real-time data on lockdown policies and mobility patterns, and a rich model of firm behavior that allows for several dimensions of heterogeneity. We find: (a) Absent government support, the failure rate of SMEs would have increased by 9 percentage points, significantly more so in emerging market economies (EMs). With policy support it only increased by 4.3 per-centage points, and even decreased in advanced economies (AEs). (b) Fiscal policy was poorly targeted: most of the funds disbursed went to firms who did not need it. (c) Nev-ertheless, we find little evidence of the policy merely postponing mass business failures or creating many 'zombie' firms: failure rates rise only slightly in 2021 once policy support is removed. Next, we build a tractable global intertemporal general equilibrium I-O model with fiscal policy. We calibrate the model to 64 countries and 36 sectors. We find that: (d) a sizeable share of the global economy is demand-constrained under COVID-19, especially so in EMs. (e) Globally, fiscal policy helped offset about 8% of the downturn in COVID, with a low 'traditional' fiscal multiplier. Yet it significantly reduced the share of demand-constrained sectors, preserving employment in these sectors. (f) Fiscal policy exerted small and negative spillovers to output in other countries but positive spillovers on employment.(g) A two-speed recovery would put significant upwards pressure on global interest rates which imposes an additional headwind on the EM recovery. (h) Corporate and sovereign spreads rise when global rates increase, suggesting that EM may face challenging external funding conditions as AEs economies normalize.]]></description><author>Gourinchas, Pierre-Olivier &amp; Kalemli-Ozcan, Sebnem &amp; Penciakova, Veronika &amp; Sander, Nick</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16576</guid></item><item><title>The impact of common law on the volume of legal services: An international study</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16565</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> We show that the heavy use of legal services relative to output in the US is not a peculiarity of the country but applies to common law countries in general. It stems largely from better ability to contract and easier access to justice. Yet in close association, common law also offers lawyers potentially more room for rent-Â¬seeking than civil law.

We embed stochastic volatilities and limits-to-international arbitrage in a two-country New Keynesian model and estimate the GE system for the US and Euro area using higher-order approximation and full-information Bayesian methods. Assessing the roles of level vs. volatility shocks and linear vs. higher-order approximations, we find that shocks to macroeconomic fundamentals together with their uncertainties can account for a sizable portion-over 40%-of the observed exchange rate variations. Using the GE estimates, we then evaluate whether the fundamental shocks in our model can deliver the UIP relationship observed in the data, and more importantly, whether the results may differ conditionally vs. unconditionally. In line with findings in previous literature, several fundamental shocks individually can indeed generate patterns consistent with data. However, their contributions unconditionally in the GE setting are quantitatively insufficient to resolve the UIP puzzle. The presence of multiple shocks, their potential interactions, and the need for estimators to fit empirical dynamics of all observables beyond just the exchange rate are all likely reasons behind this "General Equilibrium Puzzle," which underscores the importance of GE estimation beyond simulations or partial-equilibrium analyses.]]></description><author>Chen, Yu-Chin &amp; Fujiwara, Ippei &amp; Hirose, Yasuo</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16555</guid></item><item><title>On the Benefits of Repaying</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16539</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> This paper studies whether countries benefit from servicing their debts during times of widespread sovereign defaults. Colombia is typically regarded as the only large Latin American country that did not default in the 1980s. Using archival research and formal econometric estimates of Colombia's probability of default, we show that in the early 1980s Colombia's fundamentals were not significantly different from those of the Latin American countries that defaulted on their debts. We also document that the different path chosen by Colombia was due to the authorities' belief that maintaining a good reputation in the international capital market would have substantial long-term payoffs. We show that the case of Colombia is more complex than what is commonly assumed. Although Colombia had to re-profile its debts, high-level political support from the US allowed Colombia do to so outside the standard framework of an IMF program. Our counterfactual analysis shows that in the short to medium run, Colombia benefited from avoiding an explicit default. Specifically, we find that GDP growth in the 1980s was higher than that of a counterfactual in which Colombia behaved like its neighboring countries. We also test whether Colombia's behavior in the 1980s led to long-term reputational benefits. Using an event study based on a large sudden stop, we find no evidence for such long-lasting reputational gains.]]></description><author>Caselli, Francesca &amp; Faralli, Matilde &amp; Manasse, Paolo &amp; Panizza, Ugo</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16539</guid></item><item><title>The Aftermath of Debt Surges</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16537</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Debt in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is at its highest level in half a century. In about nine out of 10 EMDEs, debt is higher now than it was in 2010 and, in half of the EMDEs, debt is more than 30 percentage points of gross domestic product higher. Historically, elevated debt levels increased the incidence of debt distress, particularly in EMDEs and particularly when financial market conditions turned less benign. This paper reviews an encompassing menu of options that have, in the past, helped lower debt burdens. Specifically, it examines orthodox options (enhancing growth, fiscal consolidation, privatization, and wealth taxation) and heterodox options (inflation, financial repression, debt default and restructuring). The mix of feasible options depends on country characteristics and the type of debt. However, none of these options comes without political, economic, and social costs. Some options may ultimately be ineffective unless vigorously implemented. Policy reversals in difficult times have been common. The challenges associated with debt reduction raise questions of global governance, including to what extent advanced economies can cast their net wider to cushion prospective shocks to EMDEs.]]></description><author>Kose, Ayhan &amp; Ohnsorge, Franziska &amp; Reinhart, Carmen M. &amp; Rogoff, Kenneth</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16537</guid></item><item><title>Measuring Market Expectations</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16520</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Asset prices are a valuable source of information about financial market participants' expectations about key macroeconomic variables. However, the presence of time-varying risk premia requires an adjustment of market prices to obtain the market's rational assessment of future price and policy developments. This paper reviews empirical approaches for recovering market-based expectations. It starts by laying out the two canonical modeling frameworks that form the backbone for estimating risk premia and highlights the proliferation of risk pricing factors that result in a wide range of different asset-price-based expectation measures. It then describes a key methodological innovation to evaluate the empirical plausibility of risk premium estimates and to identify the most accurate market-based expectation measure. The usefulness of this general approach is illustrated for price expectations in the global oil market. Then, the paper provides an overview of the body of empirical evidence for monetary policy and inflation expectations with a special emphasis on market-specific characteristics that complicate the quest for the best possible market-based expectation measure. Finally, it discusses a number of economic applications where market expectations play a key role for evaluating economic models, guiding policy analysis, and deriving shock measures.]]></description><author>Baumeister, Christiane</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16520</guid></item><item><title>Measuring credit procyclicality: a new database</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16519</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> Today, the data available to estimate the credit cycle involve a trade-off between country coverage and frequency.

Compared with the general population, investors show no differences in their level of security concerns with either cash or commercial banking services. We find that cryptocurrency investors tend to be educated, young and digital natives. In recent years, a gap in ownership of cryptocurrencies across genders has emerged. We examine how investor characteristics vary across cryptocurrencies and show that owners of cryptocurrencies increasingly tend to hold their investment for longer periods.]]></description><author>Auer, Raphael &amp; Tercero Lucas, David</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16518</guid></item><item><title>An Equilibrium Theory of Nominal Exchange Rates</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16517</link><description><![CDATA[<b>September 2021</b> <p> This paper proposes an equilibrium theory of nominal exchange rates, which offers a new perspective 
 on various issues in open economy macroeconomics.
 The nominal exchange rate and portfolio choices are jointly determined in equilibrium, 
thus providing a new approach to overcoming the indeterminacy results in Kareken and Wallace (1981).
The distinctive features of this theory are that the nominal exchange rate is determined in international financial markets,
that the risk premium and UIP deviations are fully endogenous equilibrium objects and that the real exchange rate inherits its properties from the nominal exchange rate. 
In terms of policy, this novel theory implies that a country with an exchange rate peg and free asset mobility faces a tetralemma and not a trilemma, because it loses not only monetary policy independence but also fiscal policy independence.]]></description><author>Hagedorn, Marcus</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16517</guid></item><item><title>Growing Apart or Moving Together?

Using a comprehensive database of informal activity that covers a wide range of informality measures from almost 160 countries over the 1990-2018 period, we report two major results. First, fluctuations in informal-sector output are strongly positively correlated with those in formal-sector output. In contrast, fluctuations in informal employment are largely uncorrelated with those in formal-sector output. Second, movements in the formal economy tend to spillover to the informal economy. Using a novel set of instrumental variables, we show that fluctuations in formal-sector output "cause" movements in informal-sector output.]]></description><author>Elgin, Ceyhun &amp; Kose, Ayhan &amp; Ohnsorge, Franziska &amp; Yu, Shu</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16498</guid></item><item><title>Understanding Informality</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16497</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> This paper introduces a comprehensive database of informal economic activity. The database focuses on measures that have strong cross-country and over time coverage: it includes both model-based and survey-based measures of informality and covers more than 160 economies for the period 1990-2018. The paper illustrates two applications of the database. First, it distills stylized facts of informal activity, including its declining trend and pervasiveness in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Second, it documents the cyclical features of the informal economy. Overall, informal economy recessions (recoveries) do not differ significantly from those of formal economy. Like formal-economy business cycles, informal-economy business cycles tend to be shallower in advanced economies than in EMDEs. Informal employment in both advanced economies and EMDEs appears to be largely acyclical.]]></description><author>Elgin, Ceyhun &amp; Kose, Ayhan &amp; Ohnsorge, Franziska &amp; Yu, Shu</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16497</guid></item><item><title>A Tale of Two Global Monetary Policies</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16485</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> US monetary policy is not the only one with a global reach. We compare the international financial spillovers of the unconventional monetary policies of the Fed and the ECB. Monetary policy tightenings in both areas are followed by a global retrenchment in capital flows, a fall in global stock markets, and a rise in global risk measures. Thus, ECB and Fed monetary policies propagate internationally through equivalent transmission channels. ECB monetary policy shocks also affect significantly the US business and financial cycles. We produce tentative evidence that links the strength of the ECB international spillovers to the â?¬ exposure for both trade invoicing and the pricing of financial transactions.]]></description><author>Miranda-Agrippino, Silvia &amp; Nenova, Tsvetelina</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16485</guid></item><item><title>Selective Default Expectations</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16474</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Sovereign governments often discriminate between creditors during debt default episodes. This paper explores how expectations of selective default affect sovereign bond trading and sovereign risk premia based on a historical laboratory: the German external default of the 1930s. We exploit a unique feature of the interwar sovereign bond market: identical German government bonds were traded on different creditor countries' secondary debt markets but investors expected creditors from various countries to be treated differently in case of default. We show that, when creditor countries' secondary debt markets are integrated, selective default expectations are not reflected in bond yields but affect the volume of bonds traded across markets. By contrast, when creditors' debt markets are geographically segmented, a large selective risk premium can be priced in sovereign bonds. This premium accounted for up to half of the total risk premium on German external bonds during the 1930s. We establish that creditor countries' seniority ranks can be explained by their economic power over the debtor government.]]></description><author>Accominotti, Olivier &amp; Albers, Thilo &amp; Oosterlinck, Kim</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16474</guid></item><item><title>Demographics, Wealth, and Global Imbalances in the Twenty-First Century</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16470</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> We use a sufficient statistic approach to quantify the general equilibrium effects of population aging on wealth accumulation, expected asset returns, and global imbalances. Combining population forecasts with household survey data from 25 countries, we measure the compositional effect of aging: how a changing age distribution affects wealth-to-GDP, holding the age profiles of assets and labor income fixed. In a baseline overlapping generations model this statistic, in conjunction with cross-sectional information and two standard macro parameters, pins down general equilibrium outcomes. Since the compositional effect is positive, large, and heterogeneous across countries, our model predicts that population aging will increase wealth-to-GDP ratios, lower asset returns, and widen global imbalances through the twenty-first century. These conclusions extend to a richer model in which bequests, individual savings, and the tax-and-transfer system all respond to demographic change.]]></description><author>Auclert, Adrien &amp; Malmberg, Hannes &amp; Martenet, Frederic &amp; Rognlie, Matthew</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16470</guid></item><item><title>Financial crises: A survey</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16450</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Financial crises have large deleterious effects on economic activity, and as such have been the focus of a large body of research. This study surveys the existing literature on financial crises, exploring how crises are measured, whether they are predictable, and why they are associated with economic contractions. Historical narrative techniques continue to form the backbone for measuring crises, but there have been exciting developments in using quantitative data as well. Crises are predictable with growth in credit and elevated asset prices playing an especially important role; recent research points convincingly to the importance of behavioral biases in explaining such predictability. The negative consequences of a crisis are due to both the crisis itself but also to the imbalances that precede a crisis. Crises do not occur randomly, and, as a result, an understanding of financial crises requires an investigation into the booms that precede them.]]></description><author>Sufi, Amir &amp; Taylor, Alan M.</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16450</guid></item><item><title>Sharing Asymmetric Tail Risk: Smoothing, Asset Pricing and Terms of Trade</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16443</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Crises and tail events have asymmetric effects across borders, raising the value of arrangements improving insurance of macroeconomic risk. Using a two-country DSGE model, we provide an analytical and quantitative analysis of the channels through which countries gain from  sharing (tail) risk. Riskier countries gain in smoother consumption but lose in relative wealth and average consumption. Safer countries benefit from higher wealth and better average terms of trade. Calibrated using the empirical distribution of moments of GDP-growth across countries, the model suggests significant quantitative effects. We offer an algorithm for the correct solution of the equilibrium using DSGE models under complete markets, at higher order of approximation.]]></description><author>Corsetti, Giancarlo &amp; Lipinska, Anna &amp; Lombardo, Giovanni</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16443</guid></item><item><title>Ageing and welfare-state policy making: Macroeconomic Perspective</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16442</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> It has been well recognized that population ageing could generate structural changes centered around the dwindling labor force, on one hand, and the expanding dependency on the generosity of the welfare state, on the other hand. Ageing-related welfare state policy entails both fiscal issues and migration issues. The paper employs a general-equilibrium model with a policy-making focus, to help  understand the  mechanism governing the provision of social benefits, labor income taxation, capital income taxation, migration curbs on low skilled and high skilled, driven by the ageing of the  population. Greater generosity of the welfare state comes together with policy of a more liberal migration policy -- incentive compatible with the interests of the majority voters.]]></description><author>Razin, Assaf &amp; Schwemmer, Alexander</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16442</guid></item><item><title>Globalization, Freedoms and Economic Convergence: An empirical exploration of a trivariate relationship using a large panel</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16436</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Using a large panel for 95 countries and the 1972-2014 period, this paper analyses the interactions among globalization, political & civil rights and economic convergence, through a simultaneous estimation technique.

We find a two-way positive relationship between civil liberties & political rights and economic, political and social Globalization, as well as significant two-way relationships with the economic convergence (using as a proxy the ratio of GDP per capita to the US). In this way, we extend the test for the two-way relationship between Democracy and Globalization put forward by Eichengreen and Leblang (2008). Overall, we also find a virtuous cycle between Globalization, Freedoms and Economic convergence, except for non-OECD countries at early intermediate stages of development. This positive systemic effect can be put into question by the recent negative shocks on Globalization and Freedoms related to the Covid-19 pandemic.]]></description><author>Braga de Macedo, Jorge &amp; Oliveira Martins, Joaquim &amp; Tovar Jalles, João</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16436</guid></item><item><title>Dash for Dollars</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16415</link><description><![CDATA[<b>August 2021</b> <p> Within-firm variation of corporate bond spreads around the Covid-19 outbreak shows that US dollar-denominated bonds experienced larger increases in spreads relative to non-dollar bonds, especially at short maturities. Differently, in the non-dollar sample it was the spreads of longer maturity bonds that widened more markedly. Price pressures arising from a liquidity-driven dash for cash alone cannot rationalize these findings. Instead, the patterns we uncover suggest a `dash for dollars', in which investors sold their dollar-denominated assets first, with a consequent impact on prices. We link these dynamics to the dominant role of the US dollar in the international financial system.]]></description><author>Cesa-Bianchi, Ambrogio &amp; Eguren Martin, Fernando</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16415</guid></item><item><title>The Odious Haitian Independence Debt</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16413</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> This article introduces the Haitian Independence Debt of 1825 to the odious debt and sovereign debt literatures.

The story of the Haitian Independence Debt of 1825 serves as an illustrative case study.  In the context of telling that story, we provide estimates of the evolution of Haiti's external debt-to-GDP ratio over 1825-2020, and discuss the implications of the independence debt for the economy of Haiti.

Answering this question is critical for central banks trying to achieve price stability. This paper studies the experience from existing Co2 taxes in Canada and Europe, introduced over the last 30 years. Based on two separate empirical approaches, we find that carbon taxes do not have to be inflationary and may even have deflationary effects. In particular, our evidence suggests that the increase in energy prices was more than offset by a fall in the prices of services and other non-tradables. Our results are robust for Europe and Canada, as well as a number of different country groupings. At least in case of British Columbia, a contraction in household incomes and expenditures, in particular among the richer households, could explain the deflationary effect.]]></description><author>Konradt, Maximilian &amp; Weder di Mauro, Beatrice</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16396</guid></item><item><title>Financial 'Side Effects' of QE and Conventional Monetary Policy Compared</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16395</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We explore the size of financial 'side effects' of QE relative to those of conventional monetary policy for the Euro Area, UK and US. Following previous work for conventional monetary policy we examine the effects on private credit imbalances, financial market risk and asset valuation. We adopt an agnostic Bayesian VAR approach, identifying QE and conventional monetary policy shocks with four different identification schemes and two different measures of unconventional monetary policy. We compare the size of each side effect by the amount of inflation generated by each policy, as all three of these central banks were targeting inflation during this time. The relative size of these effects is at the heart of the current debate about the financial stability and wealth inequality consequences of accommodative monetary policy. While both, conventional monetary policy and QE, generate some financial 'side effects', there is no statistical evidence that the effect of QE on these variables is consistently larger than the effect of conventional monetary policy.]]></description><author>Weale, M &amp; Wieladek, Tomasz</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16395</guid></item><item><title>Pricing Ethics in the Foreign Exchange Market: Environmental, Social and Governance Ratings and Currency Premia</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16392</link><description><![CDATA[<b>July 2021</b> <p> We examine the cross-sectional predictive ability of the Refinitiv Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) score for returns in the foreign exchange market, using ESG scores aggregated at the national level, and find that ESG is a strong negative predictor of currency returns.

We show that ESG is priced in the cross-section of currency returns. We also consider the different components of ESG and show that its predictability is driven by the environmental pillar of the ESG ratings.

We then study the response of consumer prices to terms-of-trade shocks and find that these shocks have a significant and persistent effect on consumer price inflation when expectations are poorly anchored.

The blueprint for the postwar international economy agreed at Bretton Woods in 1944 envisioned nothing like today's extensive and fluid global capital market. The demise of the 1946-1973 fixed exchange rate system, however, also brought a progressive dismantling of barriers to international financial flows motivated by special-interest politics, national economic competition, and ideology â?? alongside the benign desire for a more efficient international allocation of capital. Unfortunately, free cross-border financial capital mobility can compromise governments' capacities to attain domestic economic and social goals in several ways. This essay links the dynamics of financial liberalization to the Teflon-like resilience of finance to backlash so far, and suggests that stronger backlash could emerge if national governments fail to enhance multilateral cooperation to manage the financial commons.]]></description><author>Obstfeld, Maurice</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16375</guid></item></channel></rss>
