However, it did not translate into increased bank assets and deposits as a share of national income. The banking crisis of the Great Depression ended the network expansion and reversed part of it, but the number of bank branches remained four times greater than before the war (though the French population was similar in 1910 and 1930). The distinction between indicators of credit or deposits on GDP and indicators of the density of the banking network challenges the thesis of the Great Reversal and improves understanding of the evolution of the banking system during the interwar period. We argue that inflation and increased competition explain the disconnect between the evolution of branches and the real volume of banking activity.]]></description><author>Bonhoure, Emilie &amp; Clausse, Hadrien &amp; Monnet, Eric &amp; Riva, Angelo</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16698</guid></item><item><title>Losing the inflation anchor</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16664</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Reis, Ricardo.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Inflation has an anchor in people's expectations of what its long-run value will be. If expectations persistently change, then the anchor is adrift; if they differ from the central bank's target, the anchor is lost. This paper uses data on expectations from market prices, from professional surveys, and from the cross-sectional distribution of household surveys to measure shifts in this anchor. Its main application is to the US Great Inflation. The data suggests that the anchor started drifting as early as 1967 and that this could have been spotted well before policymakers did. Using this approach on expectations data from Brazil, Turkey, South Africa, the US in the 1970s, and the US in 2021, confirms their usefulness to measure the inflation anchor in real time.]]></description><author>Reis, Ricardo</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16664</guid></item><item><title>A Safe Harbor: Wealth-Income Ratios in Switzerland Over the 20th Century and the Role of Housing Prices</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16660</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Baselgia, Enea & Martínez, Isabel Z..</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We estimate the ratio of private wealth to national income, Î²pt, for Switzerland over the period 1900â??2018. Our results indicate that the development of Î²pt in Switzerland did not follow a U-shaped pattern as in most European countries, but that the evolution was extraordinarily stable, with Î²pt oscillating around 500% over most of the 20th century. However, the wealth-income ratio has been on the rise since the turn of the century to reach 721% in 2017-a level unprecedented in the past. This considerable increase is mainly driven by large capital gains in housing wealth since 2010.

The new findings suggest that wealth-income ratios were lower before World War I than previously claimed, that wealth concentration fell over the past century and has remained low in Europe but increased in the United States, that wealth has changed from being dominated by elite-owned fortunes to consist mainly of popular wealth, and that capital shares in national income have been relatively stable over time, especially in the postwar era. These findings cast doubt on claims that a low-tax, low-regulation capitalism will generate extreme capital accumulation, and that persistent wealth equalization requires large shocks to capital coming from wars or progressive taxation. Instead, institutions that promote household wealth accumulation from below appear to be key for understanding the long-run evolution of wealth in Western societies.]]></description><author>Waldenström, Daniel</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16631</guid></item><item><title>Stunting and wasting in a growing economy: biological living standards in Portugal, 1924-1994</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16617</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Cermeño, Alexandra & Palma, Nuno Pedro G. & Pistola, Renato.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Portugal's real income per head grew by a factor of eight during the second half of the twentieth century, a period of fast convergence towards Western European standards of living.

In contrast to the "involution" thesis which posits a Malthusian trap with diminishing return in Chinese agriculture dictated by deteriorating land-labor ratio, this paper presents stylized empirical facts from 19-20th century Chinese (and Japanese) agriculture and theoretical models to demonstrate that this labor relocation across the seasons contributes to a Boserupian type of growth. It leads to rising commercialization and population density, but not necessarily urbanization, rising productivity and structural change. Ultimately, industrialization and the expansion of markets that occurred outside agriculture pulled China (and Japan) out of the "involution" to embark on modernization.]]></description><author>Ma, Debin</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16614</guid></item><item><title>Lessons of Keynes's Economic Consequences in a Turbulent Century</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16610</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Clavin, Patricia & Corsetti, Giancarlo & Obstfeld, Maurice & Tooze, Adam.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Just over a century old, John Maynard Keynes's The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919) remains a seminal document of the twentieth century. At the time, the book was a prescient analysis of political events to come. In the decades that followed, this still controversial text became an essential ingredient in the unfolding of history. In this essay, we review the arc of experience since 1919 from the perspective of Keynes's influence and his changing understanding of economics, politics, and geopolitics. We identify how he, his ideas, and this text became key reference points during times of turbulence as actors sought to manage a range of shocks. Near the end of his life, Keynes would play a central role in planning the world economy's reconstruction after World War II. We argue that the "global order" that evolved since then, marked by increasingly polarized societies, leaves the community of nations ill prepared to provide key global public goods or to counter critical collective threats.]]></description><author>Clavin, Patricia &amp; Corsetti, Giancarlo &amp; Obstfeld, Maurice &amp; Tooze, Adam</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16610</guid></item><item><title>Persistence, Randomization, and Spatial Noise</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16609</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Kelly, Morgan.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> Historical persistence studies and other regressions using spatial data commonly have severely inflated t statistics, and different standard error adjustments to correct for this return markedly different estimates.

In an increasingly financially globalised world this question becomes especially relevant. However few authors have examined it in detail empirically, despite repeated crises in Latin America, East Asia and the Eurozone from the 1980s to the 2010s. In this paper, we collect individual bank data on one of history's most striking examples of a "supply push" in foreign funds: the great inflow of capital from the developed world to Germany in the second half of the 1920s. Bank by bank we examine its effects on decisions related to leverage, lending and liquidity. The specificities of the time period â?? the Dawes Plan of 1924 as well as the relative absence of a Too-Big-to-Fail environment, which we document through extensive historiographical analysis â?? allow us to mitigate endogeneity concerns. We develop a three-step approach in which we run panel regressions including only months of falling interest-rate spreads, and apply a two-stage least-squares model in which initial bank size is used as an instrument. In all our models our results tend to converge: while capital inflows did not seem to impact banks' liquidity decisions, their impact on leverage was non-negligeable. This paper's results thus call for extra prudential oversight whenever cross-border banking flows increase significantly.]]></description><author>Collet, Stéphanie &amp; Postel-Vinay, Natacha</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16606</guid></item><item><title>Social Mobility in Sweden Before the Welfare State</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16595</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Berger, Thor & Engzell, Per & Eriksson, Björn & Molinder, Jakob.</i> <p> <b>Friday, 01 10 2021.</b> <p> We use historical census data to show that Sweden exhibited high levels of intergenerational occupational mobility several decades before the rise of the welfare state.

Using a newly assembled dataset on U.S. companies between 1926 and 1940 combining information on corporate ownership, organization, research and innovation, we attempt to explain the rise of corporate research. We argue that it was driven by companies trying to take advantage of opportunities for innovation made possible by scientific advances and an underdeveloped academic research system in the United States. Measuring field-specific scientific backwardness in several different ways, we find that large firms, business group-affiliated firms, and firms close to the technological frontier were more likely to initiate scientific research. We also find that companies in monopolistic or concentrated industries were more likely to engage in basic research. Corporate research was positively correlated with novel and valuable patents, and with market-to-book ratios. For companies choosing to do so, investment in corporate research seems to have paid off.

To do so, we build a novel exhaustive dataset on general elections in the United Kingdom from 1857 to 2017, which includes information on campaign spending (itemized by expense categories), electoral outcomes and socio-demographic characteristics for 69,042 election-constituency-candidates. We start by providing new insights on the history of British political campaigns, in particular the growing importance of advertising material, including via digital means, to the detriment of paid staff and electoral meetings. We then show that there is a strong positive correlation between expenditures and votes, and that overall the magnitude of this relationship has strongly increased since the 1880s, with a peak in the last quarter of the 20th century. We link these transformations to changes in the conduct of campaigns, and to the introduction of new information technologies. We show in particular that the expansion of local radio and broadband Internet increased the sensitivity of the electoral results to differences in campaign spending.

During the intervention, the Americans had tried to  improve the capacity of the Afghan state, maintain political stability, and end endemic political violence. While the U.S. intervention prevented violent extraconstitutional overthrows, it failed to improve Afghan state capacity or to end the war. The Afghan government fell to Taliban insurgents even before the Americans had fully departed. Afghanistan, however, was not the first American intervention that had these three aims. Over the first third of the 20th century, the U.S. intervened regularly across Latin America. We use this historical experience to test whether these earlier interventions produced similar outcomes and extract lessons. We find that U.S. interventions decreased state capacity but promoted political stability and peace --for only as long as American officials were present.

Yet, as no study has focused on the performance of art markets in times of crisis, this paper fills this gap by means of unclosing historical auction archives. We trace the long-term performance of the UK art market, which we relate to periods of crisis such as the World Wars, economic recessions, inflationary periods, and changes in monetary policy. By constructing an art price index from 1908 to 2016, we show that the value of British art expanded more than seven-fold over this century. We classify crises into economic & financial crises, systemic ones, and war periods. The results show that art outperformed equities and other financial assets in war times, which implies that it could serve as a hedge against political uncertainties. However, in times of economic and financial crises the art market underperformed the equity market. We also detail changes in art preferences for specific paintings' sizes, art schools, art objects' liquidity, art (price) segments, and art(ist)'s nationality across crises]]></description><author>David, Géraldine &amp; Li, Yuexin &amp; Oosterlinck, Kim &amp; Renneboog, Luc</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16575</guid></item><item><title>The Rise of the Educated Class</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16572</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Zeira, Joseph.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> Recent decades have seen dramatic developments in Western countries, which happened in a number of areas, political, economic and social.

a combination of ethnographic records, historical folklore information,
global data on contemporary conflict events, and large-scale surveys.
The data show systematic links between traditional herding practices
and a culture of honor. First, the culture of pre-industrial societies
that relied on animal herding emphasizes violence, punishment, and
revenge-taking. Second, contemporary ethnolinguistic groups that
historically subsisted more strongly on herding have more frequent
and severe conflict today. Third, the contemporary descendants of
herders report being more willing to take revenge and punish unfair
behavior in the globally representative Global Preferences Survey.

subsistence generated a functional psychology that has persisted until

Colombia is typically regarded as the only large Latin American country that did not default in the 1980s. Using archival research and formal econometric estimates of Colombia's probability of default, we show that in the early 1980s Colombia's fundamentals were not significantly different from those of the Latin American countries that defaulted on their debts. We also document that the different path chosen by Colombia was due to the authorities' belief that maintaining a good reputation in the international capital market would have substantial long-term payoffs. We show that the case of Colombia is more complex than what is commonly assumed. Although Colombia had to re-profile its debts, high-level political support from the US allowed Colombia do to so outside the standard framework of an IMF program. Our counterfactual analysis shows that in the short to medium run, Colombia benefited from avoiding an explicit default. Specifically, we find that GDP growth in the 1980s was higher than that of a counterfactual in which Colombia behaved like its neighboring countries. We also test whether Colombia's behavior in the 1980s led to long-term reputational benefits. Using an event study based on a large sudden stop, we find no evidence for such long-lasting reputational gains.]]></description><author>Caselli, Francesca &amp; Faralli, Matilde &amp; Manasse, Paolo &amp; Panizza, Ugo</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16539</guid></item><item><title>The Middle-Eastern Marriage Pattern?

However, evidence on the Malthusian equilibrium has been mostly confined to Europe and East Asia. We employ Egypt's population censuses in 1848 and 1868 to provide the first evidence on the pre-industrial Malthusian dynamics in the Middle East and North Africa. At the aggregate level, we document rural Egyptian women having a high fertility rate that is close to the Western European level, combined with low age at marriage and low celibacy rate, that are closer to the East Asian levels. This resulted in a uniquely high fertility regime that contributed to the region's lower wages. Next, we provide individual-level evidence on the positive correlation between fertility and income (occupation). We find that the higher fertility of rural Egyptian white-collar men is attributed to the extensive margin of fertility, and not to marital fertility differentials. Specifically, white-collar men's higher polygyny rate explains 70% of their fertility advantage, whereas their higher marriage rate and lower wife's age at marriage explain 30%, suggesting that polygyny led to a steeper income-fertility curve than in Western Europe, by enabling the Egyptian rural bourgeoisie to out-breed the poor.]]></description><author>Kumon, Yuzuru &amp; Saleh, Mohamed</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16538</guid></item><item><title>The Long-Term Effects of Industrial Policy</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16534</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Choi, Jaedo & Levchenko, Andrei A..</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> This paper provides causal evidence of the impact of industrial policy on firms' long-term performance and quantifies industrial policy's long-term welfare effects. Using a natural experiment and unique historical data during the Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) Drive in South Korea, we find large and persistent effects of firm-level subsidies on firm size. Subsidized firms are larger than those never subsidized even 30 years after subsidies ended. Motivated by this empirical finding, we build a quantitative heterogeneous firm model that rationalizes these persistent effects through a combination of learning-by-doing (LBD) and financial frictions that hinder firms from internalizing LBD. The model is calibrated to firm-level micro data, and its key parameters are disciplined with the econometric estimates. Cost-benefit analysis implies that the industrial policy generated larger benefits than costs. If the industrial policy had not been implemented, South Korea's welfare would have been 22-31% lower, depending on how long-lived are the productivity benefits of LBD. Between one-half and two-thirds of the total welfare difference comes from the long-term effects of the policy.]]></description><author>Choi, Jaedo &amp; Levchenko, Andrei A.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16534</guid></item><item><title>Commodity Prices and Global Inflation, 1851-1913</title><link>http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16526</link><description><![CDATA[<i>Gerlach, Stefan & Stuart, Rebecca.</i> <p> <b>Wednesday, 01 09 2021.</b> <p> This paper uses annual data to study the interaction of consumer and commodity prices in 15 economies over the period 1850-1913.

The discovery of precious metals was a windfall to Europe. It increased the stock of precious metals in the world more than tenfold. Compared with the case of no trade routes and no precious metals, Euro-Asian trade increases up to 20 times. We find that American precious metals were at least as important as the new trading routes as a cause of observed trade patterns.]]></description><author>Palma, Nuno Pedro G. &amp; Silva, André</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=16523</guid></item></channel></rss>
