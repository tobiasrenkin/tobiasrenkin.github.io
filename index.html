   	<p style="margin-left:6px">Abstract: We study the response of firms’ output prices to a cut in credit supply. We combine data on loans between Danish firms and banks with survey-based producer prices and transaction-based export unit values. Exploiting banks’ heterogeneous exposure to the global financial crisis, we show that loans to firms with relationships to exposed banks drop and lending rates increase. In response, firms raise prices by 3–5%. This effect is decreasing in the elasticity of firms’ demand but positive for most industrial production. Our results support the idea that firms use price increases to raise cash when external sources of liquidity dry up.</p>

   	<p style="margin-left:6px">Abstract: This paper estimates the pass-through of minimum wage increases into the prices of U.S. grocery and drug stores. We use high-frequency scanner data and leverage a large number of state-level increases in minimum wages between 2001 and 2012. We find that a 10% minimum wage hike translates into a 0.36% increase in the prices of grocery products. This magnitude is consistent with a full pass-through of cost increases into consumer prices. We show that price adjustments occur mostly in the three months following the passage of minimum wage legislation rather than after implementation, suggesting that pricing of groceries is forward-looking.</p>

   	<p style="margin-left:6px">Abstract: Consumer credit spreads significantly impact consumption and asset dynamics, affecting indebted households' spending behavior and the income sensitivity of consumption. Analyzing Danish data, we find that elevated credit spreads reduce consumption of indebted households. Our results suggest that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is countercyclical, with credit spreads playing a crucial role. We develop a HANK model, incorporating bank financing for both firms and households. Agency frictions generate a countercyclical credit spread, which induces heterogeneous incidence of aggregate shocks consistent with the data. Banking regulation, while stabilizing at the aggregate level, may induce volatility at the household level.</p>

   	<p style="margin-left:6px">Abstract: We estimate the dynamics of relative markups, marginal costs and prices over the firm life cycle using detailed firm data from Denmark. Marginal costs fall by about 20% over the first 15 years of firms' life, while prices fall only weakly by about 5%, resulting in a 15pp increase in markups. About one third of the decrease in marginal cost over the firm age is explained by movements in productivity, with the remainder being due to non-homotheticities and increasing returns in the production function. We show that markups increase following the introduction of new products and the discontinuation of old products, suggesting that product turnover is important driver of markup dynamics at the firm level.</p>

   	<p style="margin-left:6px">Abstract: We study cash holdings in the full population of Danish firms 2003–2018 and document a large and persistent increase in cash holdings after the Global Financial Crisis. This increase is driven by small and medium-sized firms, who are usually not covered in datasets used in the existing literature. Cash holdings of larger firms are stable and much lower than those of larger public firms in the U.S. We show that firm entry and exit dynamics among small firms account for essentially all of the rise in cash holdings. We document correlations of cash holdings with firm characteristics in the full population of firms, that are consistent with the those found for larger public firms. Changes in persistent characteristics of entering firms, such as size or industry, cannot explain the development of cash holdings. Rather, the increase is explained by a fall in bank borrowing among entering firms. Our results document the important role of credit for firms cash holdings, and suggest that post-crisis developments in credit markets drive both borrowing and cash holding decisions.</p>
