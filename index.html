   	<p>Abstract: This paper estimates the pass-through of minimum wage increases into the prices of U.S. grocery and drug stores. We use high-frequency scanner data and leverage a large number of state-level increases in minimum wages between 2001 and 2012. We find that a 10% minimum wage hike translates into a 0.36% increase in the prices of grocery products. This magnitude is consistent with a full pass-through of cost increases into consumer prices. We show that price adjustments occur mostly in the three months following the passage of minimum wage legislation rather than after implementation, suggesting that pricing of groceries is forward-looking.</p>

    updated November 2022.
      Conditionally accepted at AEJ: Macroeconomics.
    
   	<p>Abstract: We study the relationship between credit supply shocks and firms’ output prices during the Great Recession. We combine novel register data covering all loan relationships between Danish firms and banks with survey-based producer price index micro data and transaction-based export unit values. Our identification strategy relies on firms’ pre-existing links to banks that were differently exposed to the 2008–2009 financial crisis based on their funding strategy. We find that outstanding loans of firms with lending relationships to more exposed banks drop, while interest rates on the remainder increase. Exposed firms raise prices by 3-5% relative to other firms during the recession. Our results support the idea that firms face a trade-off between short-run profits and longer-run market share, and will increase prices to raise cash when other sources of liquidity dry up. Partial-equilibrium counterfactuals suggest that cumulative output price inflation 2008–2010 would have been 2.5% lower if more exposed Danish banks had reduced their loan supply less drastically.</p>

   	<p>Abstract: We study cash holdings in the full population of Danish firms 2003–2018 and document a large and persistent increase in cash holdings after the Global Financial Crisis. This increase is driven by small and medium-sized firms, who are usually not covered in datasets used in the existing literature. Cash holdings of larger firms are stable and much lower than those of larger public firms in the U.S. We show that firm entry and exit dynamics among small firms account for essentially all of the rise in cash holdings. We document correlations of cash holdings with firm characteristics in the full population of firms, that are consistent with the those found for larger public firms. Changes in persistent characteristics of entering firms, such as size or industry, cannot explain the development of cash holdings. Rather, the increase is explained by a fall in bank borrowing among entering firms. Our results document the important role of credit for firms cash holdings, and suggest that post-crisis developments in credit markets drive both borrowing and cash holding decisions.</p>

    January 2020.
      
    
   	<p>Abstract: We analyze export price adjustment of Swiss manufacturing firms using a novel data set of matched export, import, and domestic prices. After a large, unexpected, and permanent appreciation of the Swiss franc, export prices set in domestic currency fell less than export prices set in foreign currency. This difference prevails if we control for variation in firms’ marginal cost. Through the lens of a structural model, this difference can be traced back to strategic complementarity in price setting for firms pricing in foreign currency. Meanwhile, firms setting prices in domestic currency exhibit no strategic complementarity and follow a constant markup-pricing rule.</p>

    July 2017.
      
    
   	<p>Abstract: I study the response of markups and prices of products sold in US grocery stores to cyclical demand shocks between 2006 and 2010. I first show that under plausible assumptions on the production technology of multiproduct retailers, I can identify causal effects on markups using a combination of fixed effects and appropriate demand shifters. I then use variation in products' income elasticity of demand to construct cyclical demand shifters that are plausibly unrelated to cyclical supply shocks. I find that in response to a positive 10% demand shock, markups decrease by up to 5pp. My results support theories of countercyclical product level markups as proposed, for example, in Ravn et. al. (2006, 2008).</p>
